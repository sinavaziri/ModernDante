## ADDITIONAL NOTES FOR ALL VOICES

### Cultural Authenticity:
- All voices should have at least a subtle Italian or Mediterranean quality
- Avoid heavy stereotypical accents - keep it authentic but accessible
- The setting is medieval Italy (1300), so avoid modern speech patterns

### Literary Quality:
- These are poetic voices speaking elevated language
- Even in distress, characters speak with a certain dignity
- Rhythm and cadence matter - this is epic poetry

### Emotional Authenticity:
- The Divine Comedy encompasses the full spectrum of human emotion
- Don't be afraid of intensity - these are souls confronting eternal destinies
- Balance drama with sincerity - never melodramatic, always truthful

### Technical Considerations:
- Narrator should be instantly distinguishable from Dante (Pilgrim)
- Virgil should sound ancient and wise, clearly different from both Dantes
- Beatrice should sound otherworldly yet personal
- Character/Souls voice should be versatile enough for multiple roles
