Don't wrong me!\nHe must come down among my servants\nbecause he gave that fraudulent advice.\nSince then, I've been at his hair,\nfor one who doesn't repent cannot be absolved,\nnor can anyone repent and sin at the same time—\nthe contradiction makes it impossible.'\nOh wretched me! How I shuddered\nwhen he seized me, saying: 'Perhaps\nyou didn't think I was a logician!'\nHe carried me to Minos, who coiled\nhis tail eight times around his rigid back,\nand after biting it in great rage,\nsaid: 'This one belongs to the thieving fire.'\nSo here, where you see me, I am lost,\nand clothed like this, I go lamenting.",

Why didn't you open up?\nWhen the fourth day came, Gaddo\nthrew himself down at my feet,\nsaying, 'Father, why don't you help me?'\nAnd there he died. Just as you see me now,\nI watched the other three fall one by one\nbetween the fifth and sixth days.\nThen I, already blind, began\ngroping over each of them,\nand for three days called their names after they were dead.\nThen hunger accomplished what grief could not.\"\nWhen he finished speaking, his eyes twisted,\nhe seized that wretched skull again with his teeth,\nwhich were strong as a dog's upon the bone.\nAh, Pisa! You shame of all the peoples\nof that fair land where 'si' is spoken—\nsince your neighbors are slow to punish you,\nlet Capraia and Gorgona drift\nand dam the mouth of the Arno\nso every person in you drowns!\nFor even if Count Ugolino was known\nfor betraying your fortresses,\nyou should not have put his sons on such a cross.\nTheir youth made Uguccione and Brigata innocent,\nand the other two my song names above,\nyou modern Thebes!\nWe moved on farther, where the ice\nroughly encases another group of people,\nnot facing downward but completely upside down.\nWeeping itself prevents them from weeping here,\nand grief that finds the eyes blocked\nturns inward to increase the anguish,\nbecause the first tears form a cluster\nand, like a crystal visor,\nfill the whole socket beneath the brow.\nAnd though all feeling had abandoned\nits post in my face because of the cold,\nas if it were callused, still it seemed\nI felt some wind stirring.",

our intellect draws near to what it desires most,\nit plunges so deep that memory cannot follow.\nYet whatever of that sacred realm\nI could treasure in my mind\nshall now become the subject of my song.\nO blessed Apollo, for this final quest\nmake me such a vessel of your power\nas the gift of your beloved laurel crown requires!\nOne peak of Parnassus has been enough for me until now,\nbut here I need both summits\nto enter the arena that remains.\nCome into my heart and breathe through me\nas you did when you drew Marsyas\nfrom the sheath of his own flesh.\nO divine power, if you lend yourself to me\nso that I can make manifest\nthe shadow of the blessed realm impressed upon my mind,\nyou will see me approach your cherished tree\nand crown myself with those leaves\nthat my theme and you will make me worthy of.\nSo rarely, Father, are they gathered—\nfor triumph of Caesar or of poet—\nthe fault and shame of human desires—\nthat the Delphic laurel should bring\njoy to the glad god of Delphi\nwhen it kindles longing in anyone.\nFrom a small spark follows a great flame.\nPerhaps after me, others with better voices\nwill pray and Cyrrha will answer.\nThe lamp of the world rises to mortals\nthrough different passages, but through that one\nwhich joins four circles with three crosses,\nit emerges with better course and better star,\nand tempers and shapes the worldly wax\nmore nearly in its own image.\nThat passage had made it almost morning there\nand evening here, making that hemisphere\ncompletely bright and the other dark,\nwhen I saw Beatrice turn toward her left side,\ngazing directly at the sun.\nNo eagle ever fixed its gaze so firmly!\nAnd just as a second ray will spring\nfrom the first and rise again,\nlike a pilgrim eager to return home,\nso from her action, flowing through my eyes\ninto my imagination, I made mine,\nand fixed my gaze upon the sun beyond our mortal limit.\nMuch is permitted there that here\nis forbidden to our powers,\nby virtue of that place made as humanity's true home.\nI could not bear it long, yet not so briefly\nthat I failed to see it sparkling all around\nlike iron emerging molten from the fire.\nAnd suddenly it seemed that day was added to day,\nas if He who has the power\nhad adorned heaven with another sun.\nBeatrice stood with eyes fixed\non the eternal wheels, and I,\nremoving my sight from above, fixed it on her.\nLooking at her, I became within\nwhat Glaucus became when he tasted the herb\nthat made him peer to the sea gods.\nTo put this transformation beyond human nature into words\nis impossible—let this example suffice\nfor those to whom grace reserves the experience.\nIf I was only what you newly created of me,\nLove that governs heaven,\nyou know, you who lifted me with your light.\nWhen the wheel that you make eternal\nthrough its desire for you caught my attention\nwith the harmony you tune and measure,\nso much of heaven seemed kindled\nby the sun's flame that no rain or river\never made a lake spread so wide.\nThe strangeness of the sound and the great light\nkindled in me a desire to know their cause,\nsharper than I had ever felt before.\nAnd she who saw me as I saw myself,\nto calm my troubled mind,\nopened her mouth before I opened mine to ask.\nShe began: \"You make yourself so dense\nwith false imagining that you cannot see\nwhat you would see if you cast it off.\nYou are not on earth as you believe,\nbut lightning fleeing from its proper sphere\nnever ran as fast as you, returning to your source.\"\nIf I was freed from my first doubt\nby these few words, more smiled than spoken,\nI found myself caught in a new perplexity.\nI said: \"I was already satisfied,\nreleased from great wonder, but now I wonder\nhow I can rise through these light bodies.\"\nAt this, after a pitying sigh,\nshe turned her eyes toward me with the look\na mother gives her delirious child.\nShe began: \"All things, whatever they may be,\nhave order among themselves, and this order is the form\nthat makes the universe resemble God.\nHere the higher creatures see the traces\nof the Eternal Power, which is the goal\ntoward which the pattern I speak of tends.\nIn this order all natures are disposed\naccording to their different destinies,\nnearer or farther from their source.\nTherefore they move toward different harbors\nacross the great sea of being, each one\nwith the instinct given to carry it forward.\nThis instinct bears fire toward the moon,\nthis is the mover in mortal hearts,\nthis binds and unites the earth.\nThis bow shoots forth not only\ncreatures without intelligence,\nbut those that possess both intellect and love.\nThe Providence that orders all of this\nmakes forever quiet with its light the heaven\nin which turns the sphere with greatest speed.\nAnd there now, as to a destined place,\nthe power of that bowstring carries us,\nwhich aims every arrow at a joyful target.\nYet it is true that just as form sometimes\nfails to match the artist's intention\nbecause the material is deaf to response,\nso the creature sometimes deviates from this course,\nhaving the power, though driven this way,\nto swerve toward something else—\njust as fire may be seen\nfalling from a cloud if its first impulse\nis twisted earthward by false pleasure.\nYou should wonder no more at your ascent,\nif I judge rightly, than at a stream\nflowing from a high mountain to the valley.\nIt would be a marvel if you were deprived\nof every obstacle yet remained seated below,\nlike living fire staying quiet on earth.\"\nWith that, she turned her face back toward heaven.",

These souls did exactly that,\nhaving the power to return to their holy place.\nIf their will had been perfect, like the will\nthat held Lawrence firm upon his burning grill,\nor made Mucius ruthless toward his own hand,\nit would have driven them back along the road\nfrom which they'd been dragged, the moment they were free.\nBut such unshakeable will is far too rare.\"\nWith these words, if you've gathered them correctly,\nthe argument that would have troubled you\nmany more times has been completely refuted.\nBut now another passage cuts across\nyour vision, one so dense you couldn't thread\nyour way through it before exhaustion claimed you.\nI have planted firmly in your mind\nthat blessed souls could never speak a lie,\nbeing so close to Truth in its pure form.\nYet you might have heard from Piccarda's lips\nthat Constance kept her love for the religious veil—\nso she seems to contradict my words.\nMany times, brother, it has come to pass\nthat someone, to escape from mortal danger,\nreluctantly did what should not be done.\nJust as Alcmaeon, urged on by his father,\nkilled his own mother, becoming pitiless\nin order not to lose his sense of duty.\nAt this point I want you to remember\nthat force mingles with will, and together\nthey cause offenses that cannot be excused.\nAbsolute will never consents to evil,\nbut consents only insofar as it fears\nthat refusing might bring even greater harm.\nSo when Piccarda used those words of hers,\nshe meant the absolute will, while I meant\nthe other kind—and both of us speak truth.\"\nSuch was the flowing of that holy river\nissuing from the fountain of all truth.\nThis set to rest every one of my longings.",

On this point\nI have spoken with absolute precision.\nThis is why the Hebrews were commanded\nto make offerings always,\nthough sometimes what was offered could be changed.\nThe other element—the subject matter—\nmay indeed be such that no wrong is done\nif it's exchanged for something else.\nBut let no one shift this burden\nby personal judgment alone,\nwithout both the silver and gold keys turning.\nConsider any substitution foolish\nunless what you give up is contained\nin the replacement, as four is contained in six.\nTherefore anything so weighty\nit tips every scale\ncannot be satisfied by other payment.\nLet mortals never make vows lightly.\nBe faithful, but not blind in keeping them—\ndon't be like Jephthah with his rash offering,\nwho should have said \"I was wrong\"\nrather than compound his error by keeping it.\nAnd consider the great Greek commander, equally foolish,\nwho made Iphigenia weep for her beautiful face\nand caused both wise and simple to mourn\nwhen they heard of such worship.\nChristians, move with greater seriousness.\nDon't be like feathers blown by every wind.\nDon't think every water can wash you clean.\nYou have the Old Testament and the New,\nand the Church's shepherd to guide you—\nlet this suffice for your salvation.\nIf wicked appetite cries out for more,\nbe human beings, not mindless sheep,\nso that no Jew among you mocks you.\nDon't be like the lamb that abandons\nits mother's milk to fight playfully\nand foolishly with its own shadow.\nThis is what Beatrice said to me, exactly as I write it.\nThen, full of longing, she turned again\ntoward that region where the world is most alive.\nHer silence and the change in her expression\nimposed silence on my eager mind,\nwhich already brimmed with new questions.\nLike an arrow that strikes its target\nbefore the bowstring has stopped vibrating,\nwe sped into the second sphere.\nThere I saw my Lady so joyful\nas she entered that heaven's brightness\nthat the planet itself grew more radiant.\nIf the star was transformed and smiled,\nwhat became of me, who by my very nature\nam supremely changeable in every way?\nAs fish in a clear, peaceful pond\nare drawn toward something from outside\nthat seems like food to them,\nso I saw more than a thousand splendors\nmoving toward us, and from each one heard:",

to hand,\nchanging rulers until it came to rest on mine.\nI was Caesar, and I am Justinian,\nwho by the will of that first Love I worship\nstripped the laws of all that was useless and excessive.\nBefore I turned my attention to this work,\nI believed that Christ had but one nature, not two,\nand I was satisfied with such faith.\nBut blessed Agapetus, who was\nthe supreme shepherd, pointed me toward\nthe true faith with his words.\nI believed him, and what he declared\nI now see as clearly as you see\nthat contradictions cannot both be false and true.\nAs soon as I aligned myself with the Church,\nGod in his grace was pleased to inspire me\nwith this high calling, and I gave myself wholly to it.\nTo my general Belisarius I entrusted\nthe armies, and heaven's right hand joined with his\nso perfectly it was a sign that I should find peace.\nHere ends my answer to your first question,\nbut its nature compels me to continue\nwith more, so that you might understand\nwith what poor reason men move against\nthe sacred standard—both those who claim it falsely\nand those who oppose it entirely.\nSee how much virtue has made it worthy\nof reverence, beginning from the hour\nwhen Pallas died to give it sovereignty.\nYou know it made its home in Alba\nfor three hundred years and more, until at last\nthe three brothers fought the three for it again.\nYou know what it accomplished from the Sabine wrong\ndown to Lucretia's grief, under seven kings,\nconquering all the neighboring peoples.\nYou know what it achieved when carried\nby illustrious Romans against Brennus, against Pyrrhus,\nagainst other princes and their allies.\nFrom there came Torquatus and Quinctius,\nnamed for his unkempt hair, the Decii and Fabii—\nheroes whose fame I gladly preserve.\nIt struck down the pride of those Arabs\nwho followed Hannibal across\nthe Alpine peaks, O Po, from which you flow.\nUnder it triumphed, while still young,\nPompey and Scipio, and bitter it seemed\nto that hill beneath which you were born.\nThen, near the time when heaven willed\nto bring the whole world to serene peace,\nCaesar took it up by Rome's command.\nWhat it accomplished from the Var to the Rhine\nthe Isère witnessed, and the Saône and Seine,\nand every valley that feeds the Rhône.\nWhat it achieved after leaving Ravenna\nand leaping the Rubicon was such swift flight\nthat neither tongue nor pen could follow.\nIt wheeled its legions toward Spain,\nthen toward Durrës, and struck at Pharsalus\nso hard the burning Nile felt the blow.\nIt saw again Antandros and the Simois\nwhere it began, and where Hector lies,\nthen stirred itself—ill fortune for Ptolemy.\nFrom there it fell like lightning upon Juba,\nthen wheeled back toward your West\nwhere it heard Pompey's trumpet sound.\nWhat it accomplished with the next standard-bearer\nmakes Brutus and Cassius howl together in Hell,\nand left Modena and Perugia grieving.\nThe wretched Cleopatra still weeps\nbecause of it—she who, fleeing before it,\ntook sudden black death from the asp.\nWith Augustus it ran even to the Red Sea shore;\nwith him it brought the world such peace\nthat Janus's temple was closed.\nBut what this standard that compels me to speak\nachieved before and should achieve after\nthroughout the mortal realm beneath it\nappears small and dim\nif you look upon it in the hand of the third Caesar\nwith clear eyes and pure love—\nbecause the living Justice that inspires me\ngranted it, in his hand of whom I speak,\nthe glory of wreaking vengeance for divine wrath.\nNow pay attention to my answer:\nlater it ran with Titus to take vengeance\nupon the vengeance for that ancient sin.\nAnd when the Lombard tooth bit\nthe Holy Church, then under those wings\nCharlemagne came victorious to her aid.\nNow you can judge those whom I accused above\nand their crimes, which are the cause\nof all your sufferings.\nAgainst the public standard one faction opposes\nthe yellow lilies, another claims it for their party,\nso it's hard to see which sins more.\nLet the Ghibellines practice their craft\nunder some other banner—for disaster always follows\nthose who separate this standard from justice.\nAnd let not this new Charles strike it down,\nhe and his Guelphs, but let him fear the talons\nthat tore the hide from a nobler lion.\nMany times already have sons wept\nfor their father's crimes—let him not think\nthat God will trade his coat of arms for lilies.\nThis small planet adorns itself\nwith good spirits who were active in life\nso that fame and honor might follow them.\nWhen earthly desires rise to such heights,\ndeviating from their true course,\nthe rays of authentic love must mount less brightly upward.\nBut that our wages match exactly\nour merit is part of our joy,\nbecause we see them neither less nor greater.\nHere living Justice so sweetens\nour affection that it can never again\nbe twisted toward any wickedness.\nDifferent voices create sweet harmonies;\nso in our life the different ranks\nrender sweet harmony among these spheres.\nWithin the compass of this very pearl\nshines the light of Romeo, whose grand\nand beautiful work was poorly rewarded.\nBut the Provençals who worked against him\nhave not had the last laugh—he goes badly\nwho makes his gain from another's good deeds.\nRaymond Berenger had four daughters,\neach one a queen, and Romeo accomplished this—\na poor man and a pilgrim.\nThen malicious words prompted the count\nto demand an accounting from this just man\nwho had given him seven and five for every ten.\nRomeo departed poor and aged,\nand if the world could know the heart he carried\nwhile begging his bread bit by bit,\nmuch as it praises him now, it would praise him more.",

carefully, for my words\nwill give you a great teaching.\nBy refusing to accept the limits\nplaced on his will for his own good,\nthat man who was never born\ndamned himself and all his children.\nSo the human race below\nlay sick for many centuries in great error,\nuntil it pleased the Word of God to descend\nto where our nature, estranged from its Maker,\ncould be joined to him in one person\nby the sole act of his eternal love.\nNow direct your attention to what I say:\nthis nature, when united with its Creator,\nwas pure and good as when first made.\nBut by itself alone it was banished\nfrom Paradise, because it turned away\nfrom the path of truth and life.\nTherefore the penalty the cross offered,\nmeasured against the nature Christ assumed,\nnever struck with such perfect justice—\nyet none was ever so unjust,\nconsidering the Person who suffered,\nin whom that nature was contained.\nFrom one act came opposite results:\none death pleased both God and the Jews,\nmade earth tremble and heaven open.\nIt should no longer seem difficult\nwhen you hear that a just vengeance\nwas later justly avenged by a just court.\nBut now I see your mind entangled\nin thought after thought, knotted tight,\ndesperately wanting to free itself.\nYou say, 'I understand what I hear clearly,\nbut why did God choose\nonly this method for our redemption?'\nThis decree remains buried, brother,\nfrom the eyes of everyone whose nature\nhas not yet matured in love's flame.\nSince one can gaze long at this mystery\nand perceive little, I will explain\nwhy this way was most worthy.\nDivine Goodness, which spurns all envy,\nburns so brightly within itself\nthat it unfolds eternal beauties.\nWhatever flows directly from this source\nhas no end, for its seal\ncan never be removed once set.\nWhatever rains down directly from this\nis completely free, not subject\nto the influence of created things.\nThe more something conforms to this,\nthe more it pleases, for the blessed fire\nthat illuminates all things\nis most alive in what most resembles it.\nThe human creature was advantaged\nwith all these gifts, and lacking any one,\nmust fall from nobility.\nSin alone strips away this franchise,\nmakes us unlike the Supreme Good,\nso we are barely touched by its light\nand cannot return to our dignity\nunless we fill transgression's emptiness\nwith just suffering for criminal pleasures.\nYour nature, when it sinned completely\nin its very seed, was driven\nfrom these dignities as from Paradise,\nnor could it recover by any path—\nif you examine this with subtle care—\nexcept by crossing one of two fords:\neither God through mercy alone\ngrants forgiveness, or humanity itself\nmakes satisfaction for its folly.\nFix your gaze now deep into the abyss\nof eternal counsel, listening\nto my words with all attention.\nHumanity in its limitations had no power\nto make satisfaction, unable to descend\nin humble obedience as far\nas it had thought to rise in disobedience.\nFor this reason humanity was excluded\nfrom the power of self-satisfaction.\nTherefore it was necessary for God\nto restore humanity to perfect life\nby his own ways—one or both of them.\nBut since the doer's action is more pleasing\nthe more it displays the goodness\nof the heart from which it springs,\nDivine Goodness that imprints the world\nwas content to proceed by all its ways\nto lift you up again.\nNever between first day and final night\nwas there or will there be such high\nand magnificent proceeding by either path.\nGod was more generous giving himself\nto make humanity able to rise again\nthan if he had simply pardoned.\nAll other methods would have been insufficient\nfor justice, had not the Son of God\nhumbled himself to become incarnate.\nNow, to satisfy completely every desire of yours,\nI return to clarify one point\nso you may see as I do.\nYou say: 'I see air, fire,\nwater, earth, and all their combinations\ncome to corruption and endure briefly,\nyet these things too were created.'\nIf what I have said were true,\nthey should be secure from corruption.\nThe Angels, brother, and this pure realm\nwhere you now stand can be called created\nexactly as they exist in their complete being.\nBut all the elements you have named\nand everything made from them\nare informed by created power.\nCreated was the matter they possess,\ncreated was the shaping influence\nwithin these stars that circle them.\nThe soul of every animal and plant\ndraws from the ray and motion\nof the holy lights through its natural temperament.\nBut your life is breathed directly\nby Supreme Beneficence, who so enamors it\nwith herself that it desires her forever.\nFrom this you can further conclude\nyour resurrection, if you remember again\nhow human flesh was first fashioned\nwhen both our first parents were made.",

O true good!\nGiles goes barefoot, Sylvester goes barefoot,\nfollowing the bridegroom—so much does the bride delight them!\nThen that father and master departed\nwith his Lady and that family\nwhich now wore the humble cord.\nNo cowardice weighed down his heart\nat being Peter Bernardone's son,\nor at appearing wonderfully despised.\nInstead, with royal resolve,\nhe revealed his firm intention to Innocent\nand received the first seal on his order.\nAfter the poor followers increased\nbehind this man whose wonderful life\ndeserves to be sung in heaven's glory,\nthe holy purpose of this leader\nwas crowned with a second crown\nby Honorius through the Eternal Spirit.\nWhen, thirsting for martyrdom,\nhe preached Christ in the Sultan's proud presence,\nalong with others who followed him,\nand finding the people too unripe for conversion\nand not wanting to remain there uselessly,\nhe returned to harvest Italian souls.\nOn the harsh rock between Tiber and Arno,\nfrom Christ he received the final seal,\nwhich his body bore for two full years.\nWhen He who had chosen him for such goodness\nwas pleased to draw him up to the reward\nhe had earned through humility,\nto his brothers, as to rightful heirs,\nhe entrusted his most dear Lady,\ncommanding them to love her faithfully.\nFrom her embrace his illustrious soul\nchose to depart, returning to its kingdom,\nwanting no other bier for his body.\nNow consider what kind of man\nwas fit to be a companion on the high seas,\nkeeping Peter's ship on its true course.\nThis man was our patriarch.\nSo whoever follows him as he commands\ncan see that his cargo is good merchandise.\nBut his flock has grown so greedy\nfor new pastures that they cannot help\nbut scatter across different fields.\nThe farther his sheep wander\nfrom him, remote and vagabond,\nthe emptier of milk they return to the fold.\nTruly, some still fear harm\nand stay close to the shepherd,\nbut they are so few that little cloth\ncould furnish all their hoods.\nNow if my words are not unclear,\nif you have listened carefully,\nif you remember what I've said,\nyour questions will be partly answered.\nYou'll see the plant that's being pruned away\nand understand the rebuke contained in the words:\n'Where one grows fat, if he doesn't stray.'",

it,\njoining motion to motion, song to song—\na song that surpasses our earthly music,\nour mortal voices, in those sweet harmonies\nas much as original light outshines reflection.\nLike two parallel rainbows arcing across delicate clouds,\nidentical in color, when Juno commands her messenger—\nthe outer born from the inner,\nlike the voice of that wandering nymph\nwhom love consumed as sun consumes mist—\nthose bows that make people here recall\nGod's covenant with Noah,\na promise that the world would never again\nbe covered by flood.\nSo these twin garlands of eternal roses\nsurrounded us completely,\nthe outer circle answering the inner.\nAfter the dancing and all the grand celebration—\nthe singing and the brilliant flashing\nof radiance upon radiance, joyful and tender—\nsuddenly stopped together, all at once, in perfect harmony\n(like eyes that must close and open\ntogether when the will moves them),\nfrom the heart of one of the new lights\ncame a voice that made me turn toward it\nlike a compass needle swinging to its star.\nAnd it began: \"The love that makes me beautiful\ncompels me to speak of the other leader,\nthe one for whom mine has been so well praised here.\nWhere one is mentioned, the other should be brought forward,\nso that as they were united in their warfare,\ntheir glory too might shine together.\nChrist's army, which had cost so much to arm again,\nmoved slowly behind the standard—\nuncertain, fearful, reduced to few.\nBut the Emperor who reigns forever\nprovided for his endangered host\nthrough grace alone, not because it was worthy.\nAs has been said, he brought aid to his Bride\nwith two champions, whose deeds and words\ndrew the scattered people back together.\nIn that land where the gentle west wind rises\nto open fresh leaves that clothe\nEurope in new green,\nnot far from the beating waves\nbehind which the sun in its long journey\nsometimes hides from every human eye,\nstands the blessed city of Calahorra,\nprotected by the mighty shield\nwhere the Lion is both subject and sovereign.\nThere was born the passionate lover\nof Christian Faith, the consecrated athlete,\nkind to his own people, merciless to his enemies.\nWhen his mind was first formed,\nit was filled with such vital force\nthat it made his mother prophetic.\nAs soon as the marriage was completed\nbetween him and Faith at the baptismal font,\nwhere each endowed the other with salvation,\nthe woman who had given her consent for him\nsaw in a dream the wondrous fruit\nthat would spring from him and his heirs.\nSo that he might be understood as he truly was,\na spirit descended from this place to name him\nwith the possessive form of Him\nto whom he belonged completely.\nHe was called Dominic—and of him I speak\nas of the farmer Christ chose\nto help him in his garden.\nHe truly seemed Christ's messenger and servant,\nfor the first love revealed in him\nwas the first teaching Christ had given.\nHis nurse would often find him\nsilent and wakeful on the ground,\nas if he meant to say: 'This is why I came.'\nO Felix, his father—truly blessed!\nO Joanna, his mother—truly favored by God,\nif these names mean what they are said to mean!\nNot for the worldly success that people strive for now,\nfollowing canon lawyers and legal scholars,\nbut through his hunger for the true bread,\nhe quickly became so great a teacher\nthat he began to tend the vineyard\nwhich withers when the keeper proves faithless.\nFrom the Papal See—once more generous\nto the righteous poor, not through its own nature\nbut through him who sat there then and has since declined—\nhe asked not for the right to give back\ntwo or three coins out of six,\nnot for any lucrative appointment,\nnot for 'the tithes that belong to God's poor,'\nbut for permission to battle the wayward world\nfor the sake of that seed\nfrom which these twenty-four plants around you grew.\nThen with doctrine and determination together,\nbearing apostolic authority, he set out\nlike a torrent bursting from a mountain spring.\nHis force struck hardest\nagainst heretical offshoots\nwherever he met the greatest resistance.\nFrom him flowed many streams\nthat water the Catholic garden,\nmaking its plantings more alive and strong.\nIf such was one wheel of the chariot\nby which Holy Church defended itself\nand won its battle in the field,\nthe excellence of the other wheel should be\nperfectly clear to you—\nthe one Thomas praised so courteously before I came.\nBut the track that the highest part\nof its rim once made lies abandoned now,\nso that where crust once was, now there is mold.\nHis family, who once walked straight ahead\nwith their feet following in his footsteps,\nhave turned around completely,\nsetting toe where heel should be.\nSoon they will learn what harvest\nthis bad farming yields, when the weeds\ncomplain that the storehouse has been taken from them.\nYet I say this: whoever searches our book\npage by page would still find some leaves\nwhere he could read: 'I am as I have always been.'\nSuch pages will not come from Casale or Acquasparta,\nfrom where men come to the written rule—\none avoiding it, the other narrowing it.\nI am the life of Bonaventure of Bagnoregio,\nwho in great offices always\nput aside worldly considerations.\nHere are Illuminato and Augustine,\namong the first barefoot beggars\nwho with the cord became friends of God.\nHugh of Saint Victor is here with them,\nand Peter Mangiador, and Peter of Spain,\nwho shines below in his twelve volumes.\nNathan the prophet and John Chrysostom the archbishop,\nAnselm and Donatus, who deigned\nto put his hand to the first art.\nHere is Rabanus, and beside me shines\nthe Calabrian Abbot Joachim,\ngifted with the spirit of prophecy.\nThe passionate courtesy and wise words\nof Brother Thomas moved me\nto celebrate so great a champion,\nand with me they have moved all this company.\"",

Now the cavern is fully opened\nThat has concealed from you the living justice\nYou have questioned so persistently.\nYou asked: 'A man is born on the shore\nOf the Indus, where no one can speak\nOf Christ, or read, or write.\nAll his desires and actions\nAre good, as far as human reason sees,\nWithout sin in life or speech.\nHe dies unbaptized and without faith—\nWhere is the justice that condemns him?\nWhat is his fault if he does not believe?'\nWho are you to sit in judgment\nA thousand miles away\nWith the short sight of a single span?\nTruly, for one who argues subtly with me,\nIf Scripture were not over you as guide,\nThere would be marvelous occasion for doubt.\nO earthbound animals! O dull minds!\nThe primal will, good in itself,\nHas never moved away from itself, the Supreme Good.\nOnly what accords with it is just—\nNo created good draws it toward itself,\nBut it, by radiating forth, creates that good.\"\nLike a stork circling above her nest\nAfter feeding her young ones,\nWhile the fed chick gazes up at her,\nSo I lifted my face, and such\nBecame that blessed image, moving its wings\nDriven by so many counsels.\nWheeling around, it sang: \"As my notes\nAre to you, who cannot understand them,\nSo is eternal judgment to mortals.\"\nThose shining splendors of the Holy Spirit\nFell silent then, still within the standard\nThat made the Romans revered throughout the world.\nIt continued: \"To this kingdom\nNo one has ever ascended without faith in Christ,\nBefore or after he was nailed to the tree.\nBut look—many cry 'Christ! Christ!'\nWho at the judgment will be far less close\nTo him than some who never knew Christ's name.\nSuch Christians the Ethiopian will condemn\nWhen the two companies are divided,\nOne forever rich, the other poor.\nWhat might the Persians say to your kings\nWhen they see that book opened\nIn which all their shameful deeds are written?\nThere will be seen, among Albert's works,\nThat which will soon set the pen in motion,\nMaking the kingdom of Prague desolate.\nThere will be seen the suffering he brings to the Seine\nBy counterfeiting coin—he who will die\nBy a wild boar's blow. There will be seen\nThe pride that kindles thirst,\nDriving the Scot and Englishman so mad\nThey cannot stay within their own borders.\nSeen too the luxury and soft living\nOf Spain's king, and Bohemia's,\nWho never knew nor wanted courage.\nSeen the Cripple of Jerusalem—\nHis goodness marked by a single I\nWhile the opposite earns an M.\nSeen the greed and cowardice\nOf him who guards the Island of Fire\nWhere Anchises ended his long life—\nAnd to show how wretched he is,\nHis record will be written in abbreviations\nThat note much in little space.\nTo everyone will appear the foul deeds\nOf uncle and brother, who dishonored\nA nation so renowned, and two crowns.\nHe of Portugal and Norway will be known there,\nAnd he of Rascia too, who saw\nThe Venetian coin to his sorrow.\nO happy Hungary, if she lets herself\nBe wronged no more!

silent,\nher face lit with a smile,\ngazing steadily at the point of light that had overwhelmed me.\nThen she began: \"I will tell you what I know you long to hear,\nthough you haven't asked.\nI have seen it all where every When and Where converges.\nNot to gain anything for himself—impossible—\nbut so his splendor might declare through its radiance: 'I exist.'\nIn his eternity beyond time,\nbeyond all boundaries, as it pleased him,\nEternal Love opened into new loves.\nHe was not lying dormant before this moment—\nthere was no 'before' or 'after'\nwhen God moved upon these waters.\nMatter and Form, separate yet joined,\ncame into being without flaw,\nlike three arrows released simultaneously\nfrom a three-stringed bow.\nAnd just as sunlight flashes through glass,\namber, or crystal with no delay\nbetween its arrival and full presence,\nso this threefold creation\nblazed forth from its Lord all at once,\nwith no sequence of beginning.\nOrder was created alongside the substances themselves.\nAt the summit of the world\nwere placed those beings of pure action—the angels.\nAt the bottom, pure potential—raw matter.\nIn between, potential bound to action\nby a bond that can never be broken.\nJerome wrote that angels were created\nlong ages before the material world,\nbut this truth appears in many places\nwritten by the Holy Spirit's scribes—\nyou'll find it if you look carefully.\nEven reason glimpses this,\nfor it makes no sense that the movers of the spheres\nwould lack their perfection for so long.\nNow you know where and when and how\nthese Loves were created—\nthree fires of curiosity extinguished in your desire.\nBefore you could count to twenty,\nsome of these angels\ndisrupted the foundation of your elements.\nThe rest remained and began this art\nyou see before you, circling with such joy\nthey never cease their dance.\nThe fall came through the cursed pride\nof that one you saw\ncrushed beneath the weight of all the world.\nBut those you see here were humble,\nrecognizing themselves as made from that goodness\nwhich fitted them for such understanding.\nTheir vision was lifted higher\nby enlightening grace and their own merit,\nso their will is complete and unwavering.\nDon't doubt this—be certain:\nit is worthy to receive this grace\nin proportion to how the heart opens to it.\nNow in this assembly you can contemplate much\nif you gather up my words\nwithout needing further help.\nBut since on earth, in your schools,\nthey teach that angels possess\nhearing, memory, and will,\nI'll say more, so you can see\nthe pure truth that's muddled down there\nby equivocation in such lessons.\nThese beings, joyful in God's presence,\nnever turn their gaze away\nfrom the one from whom nothing is hidden.\nSo their vision is never blocked by new objects,\nnor do they need to remember\nthrough interrupted thought.\nYet below, people dream while awake,\nsome believing they speak truth, others not—\nthe latter bear greater sin and shame.\nYou don't follow one path in philosophy;\nlove of appearances and thinking about them\ncarries you away.\nEven this is tolerated here with less scorn\nthan when Holy Scripture is set aside\nor twisted from its meaning.\nThey don't consider how much blood it costs\nto plant it in the world,\nor how much it pleases the one\nwho stays humbly close to it.\nEach strives for show, making up his own ideas,\nand preachers expound on these\nwhile the Gospel falls silent.\nOne claims the moon reversed course\nduring Christ's Passion, blocking the sun\nso light couldn't reach below—\na lie, for the light hid itself willingly,\nand this eclipse reached Spaniards and Indians\nas well as Jews.\nFlorence doesn't have as many men named Lapi and Bindi\nas there are fables like this\nshouted from pulpits year after year.\nThe lambs who don't know better\nreturn from pasture fed on wind,\nand ignorance doesn't excuse the harm.\nChrist didn't tell his first followers\n'Go preach idle tales to the world,'\nbut gave them a true foundation.\nThis rang so clearly from their voices\nthat in the battle to kindle faith,\nthey made the Gospel their shields and spears.\nNow people go forth with jokes and entertainment to preach,\nand if they make the crowd laugh,\ntheir hood swells with pride—nothing more required.\nBut such a creature nests in that cowl\nthat if ordinary people saw it,\nthey'd understand what pardons they trust in—\nthe source of such great folly on earth\nthat without proof or testimony\nthey flock to every indulgence.\nThis is how Saint Anthony fattens his pig,\nalong with many others worse than pigs,\npaying with counterfeit coin.\nBut since we've wandered far enough,\nturn your eyes back to the straight path\nso we can shorten the journey.\nThis angelic nature multiplies itself\nin such numbers that no speech\nor mortal imagination can reach so far.\nIf you note what Daniel revealed,\nyou'll see that in his thousands\na definite number lies concealed.\nThe primal light that illuminates all\nis received in as many ways\nas there are splendors joined with it.\nSince affection follows the act of understanding,\nlove's sweetness burns with varying intensity—\nsome tepid, others blazing.\nNow behold the height and breadth\nof eternal power, which has made\nso many mirrors of itself where it is broken,\nwhile remaining one as before.\"",
