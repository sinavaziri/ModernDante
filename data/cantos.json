      "original": "Midway upon the journey of our life I found myself within a forest dark, For the straight-forward pathway had been lost. Ah me! how hard a thing it is to say What was this forest savage, rough, and stern, Which in the very thought renews the fear. So bitter is it, death is little more; But of the good to treat, which there I found, Speak will I of the other things I saw there. I cannot well repeat how there I entered, So full was I of slumber at the moment In which I had abandoned the true way. But after I had reached a mountain's foot, At that point where the valley terminated, Which had with consternation pierced my heart, Upward I looked, and I beheld its shoulders, Vested already with that planet's rays Which leadeth others right by every road. Then was the fear a little quieted That in my heart's lake had endured throughout The night, which I had passed so piteously. And even as he, who, with distressful breath, Forth issued from the sea upon the shore, Turns to the water perilous and gazes; So did my soul, that still was fleeing onward, Turn itself back to re-behold the pass Which never yet a living person left. After my weary body I had rested, The way resumed I on the desert slope, 4 So that the firm foot ever was the lower. And lo! almost where the ascent began, A panther light and swift exceedingly, Which with a spotted skin was covered o'er! And never moved she from before my face, Nay, rather did impede so much my way, That many times I to return had turned. The time was the beginning of the morning, And up the sun was mounting with those stars That with him were, what time the Love Divine At first in motion set those beauteous things; So were to me occasion of good hope, The variegated skin of that wild beast, The hour of time, and the delicious season; But not so much, that did not give me fear A lion's aspect which appeared to me. He seemed as if against me he were coming With head uplifted, and with ravenous hunger, So that it seemed the air was afraid of him; And a she-wolf, that with all hungerings Seemed to be laden in her meagreness, And many folk has caused to live forlorn! She brought upon me so much heaviness, With the affright that from her aspect came, That I the hope relinquished of the height. And as he is who willingly acquires, And the time comes that causes him to lose, Who weeps in all his thoughts and is despondent, E'en such made me that beast withouten peace, Which, coming on against me by degrees Thrust me back thither where the sun is silent. While I was rushing downward to the lowland, Before mine eyes did one present himself, Who seemed from long-continued silence hoarse. When I beheld him in the desert vast, \"Have pity on me,\" unto him I cried, \"Whiche'er thou art, or shade or real man!\" He answered me: \"Not man; man once I was, And both my parents were of Lombardy, And Mantuans by country both of them. 5 \n'Sub Julio' was I born, though it was late, And lived at Rome under the good Augustus, During the time of false and lying gods. A poet was I, and I sang that just Son of Anchises, who came forth from Troy, After that Ilion the superb was burned. But thou, why goest thou back to such annoyance? Why climb'st thou not the Mount Delectable, Which is the source and cause of every joy?\" \"Now, art thou that Virgilius and that fountain Which spreads abroad so wide a river of speech?\" I made response to him with bashful forehead. \"O, of the other poets honour and light, Avail me the long study and great love That have impelled me to explore thy volume! Thou art my master, and my author thou, Thou art alone the one from whom I took The beautiful style that has done honour to me. Behold the beast, for which I have turned back; Do thou protect me from her, famous Sage, For she doth make my veins and pulses tremble.\" \"Thee it behoves to take another road,\" Responded he, when he beheld me weeping, \"If from this savage place thou wouldst escape; Because this beast, at which thou criest out, Suffers not any one to pass her way, But so doth harass him, that she destroys him; And has a nature so malign and ruthless, That never doth she glut her greedy will, And after food is hungrier than before. Many the animals with whom she weds, And more they shall be still, until the Greyhound Comes, who shall make her perish in her pain. He shall not feed on either earth or pelf, But upon wisdom, and on love and virtue; 'Twixt Feltro and Feltro shall his nation be; Of that low Italy shall he be the saviour, On whose account the maid Camilla died, Euryalus, Turnus, Nisus, of their wounds; Through every city shall he hunt her down, 6 \nUntil he shall have driven her back to Hell, There from whence envy first did let her loose. Therefore I think and judge it for thy best Thou follow me, and I will be thy guide, And lead thee hence through the eternal place, Where thou shalt hear the desperate lamentations, Shalt see the ancient spirits disconsolate, Who cry out each one for the second death; And thou shalt see those who contented are Within the fire, because they hope to come, Whene'er it may be, to the blessed people; To whom, then, if thou wishest to ascend, A soul shall be for that than I more worthy; With her at my departure I will leave thee; Because that Emperor, who reigns above, In that I was rebellious to his law, Wills that through me none come into his city. He governs everywhere, and there he reigns; There is his city and his lofty throne; O happy he whom thereto he elects!\" And I to him: \"Poet, I thee entreat, By that same God whom thou didst never know, So that I may escape this woe and worse, Thou wouldst conduct me there where thou hast said, That I may see the portal of Saint Peter, And those thou makest so disconsolate.\" Then he moved on, and I behind him followed. 7",
      "modern": "At the midpoint of my life's journey\nI found myself lost in a dark forest,\nhaving strayed from the straight path.\n\nHow difficult it is to describe\nwhat that savage, dense, and harsh woodland was like—\nthe very memory renews my fear.\nDeath itself is hardly more bitter.\nBut to speak of the good I discovered there,\nI'll tell of the other things I witnessed.\n\nI cannot clearly recall how I entered,\nso drowsy was I at that moment\nwhen I abandoned the true way.\n\nBut when I reached the base of a hill\nwhere that valley of terror ended—\nthe valley that had pierced my heart with dread—\nI looked up and saw the summit\nalready clothed in rays of light\nfrom that star which guides all travelers true.\n\nThen the fear that had pooled\nin the lake of my heart throughout\nthat night of such anguish began to quiet.\n\nLike a man who, gasping for breath,\nemerges from the sea onto shore\nand turns back to stare at the dangerous waters,\nso my soul, still in flight,\nturned to gaze once more upon that passage\nno living person has ever escaped.\n\nAfter I had rested my weary body,\nI resumed my way up the deserted slope,\nalways placing my weight on the lower foot.\n\nBut look—almost where the climb began,\na leopard appeared, light and swift,\ncovered with a spotted coat.\nShe would not move from before my face\nbut blocked my path so completely\nthat I turned back many times.\n\nIt was early morning,\nand the sun was rising with those same stars\nthat accompanied it when Divine Love\nfirst set those beautiful things in motion.\nThe hour, the sweet season, and that wild beast's\ndappled skin gave me reason for hope—\n\nbut not enough to keep me from fearing\na lion that suddenly appeared.\nHe seemed to be coming straight at me,\nhead raised high, ravenously hungry,\nso fierce the very air seemed to tremble.\n\nAnd then a she-wolf, who appeared\nloaded down with every kind of craving\nin her gaunt frame—\nshe who has made so many live in sorrow.\nShe filled me with such dread,\nsuch terror radiating from her presence,\nthat I gave up all hope of reaching the height.\n\nLike someone who delights in winning\nbut when the time of loss arrives\nweeps and despairs in all his thoughts,\nso that restless beast made me feel\nas she advanced toward me, step by step,\ndriving me back toward where the sun is silent.\n\nAs I rushed downward toward the lowland,\na figure appeared before my eyes—\none who seemed hoarse from long silence.\n\nWhen I saw him in that vast wilderness\nI cried out: \"Have mercy on me,\nwhatever you are—shade or living man!\"\n\n\"Not a man,\" he answered, \"though once I was,\nand my parents were both from Lombardy,\nboth Mantuans by birth.\nI was born under Julius Caesar, though late in his reign,\nand lived in Rome under good Augustus\nin the time of the false and lying gods.\n\nI was a poet, and I sang of that righteous\nson of Anchises who sailed from Troy\nafter proud Ilium burned.\nBut you—why do you return to such torment?\nWhy don't you climb the Mount of Joy,\nwhich is the source and cause of all happiness?\"\n\n\"Are you truly that Virgil, that fountain\nfrom which flows such a broad river of speech?\"\nI answered him, my face flushed with shame.\n\n\"You are the honor and light of all other poets.\nLet my long study and great love serve me—\nthe love that drove me to know your work by heart.\nYou are my master and my author,\nyou alone are the one from whom I learned\nthe noble style that has brought me honor.\n\nLook at the beast that forced me to turn back—\nsave me from her, renowned sage,\nfor she makes my veins and pulse tremble.\"\n\n\"You must take another road,\" he replied\nwhen he saw me weeping,\n\"if you want to escape this savage place.\nThis beast that makes you cry out\nlets no one pass along her way\nbut harasses them until she destroys them.\n\nHer nature is so vicious and depraved\nthat she never satisfies her greedy appetite—\nafter feeding she hungers more than before.\nMany are the creatures she mates with,\nand there will be more, until the Greyhound comes\nwho will make her die in agony.\n\nHe will not feed on land or treasure\nbut on wisdom, love, and virtue.\nBetween Feltro and Feltro his birth shall be.\nHe will be the salvation of that humble Italy\nfor which the virgin Camilla died,\nand Euryalus, Turnus, and Nisus fell wounded.\n\nHe will hunt her through every city\nuntil he drives her back to Hell,\nfrom where envy first released her.\n\nTherefore I think it best for you\nto follow me.

      "original": "Day was departing, and the embrowned air Released the animals that are on earth From their fatigues; and I the only one Made myself ready to sustain the war, Both of the way and likewise of the woe, Which memory that errs not shall retrace. O Muses, O high genius, now assist me! O memory, that didst write down what I saw, Here thy nobility shall be manifest! And I began: \"Poet, who guidest me, Regard my manhood, if it be sufficient, Ere to the arduous pass thou dost confide me. Thou sayest, that of Silvius the parent, While yet corruptible, unto the world Immortal went, and was there bodily. But if the adversary of all evil Was courteous, thinking of the high effect That issue would from him, and who, and what, To men of intellect unmeet it seems not; For he was of great Rome, and of her empire In the empyreal heaven as father chosen; The which and what, wishing to speak the truth, Were stablished as the holy place, wherein Sits the successor of the greatest Peter. Upon this journey, whence thou givest him vaunt, Things did he hear, which the occasion were Both of his victory and the papal mantle. Thither went afterwards the Chosen Vessel, To bring back comfort thence unto that Faith, 8 Which of salvation's way is the beginning. But I, why thither come, or who concedes it? I not Aeneas am, I am not Paul, Nor I, nor others, think me worthy of it. Therefore, if I resign myself to come, I fear the coming may be ill-advised; Thou'rt wise, and knowest better than I speak.\" And as he is, who unwills what he willed, And by new thoughts doth his intention change, So that from his design he quite withdraws, Such I became, upon that dark hillside, Because, in thinking, I consumed the emprise, Which was so very prompt in the beginning. \"If I have well thy language understood,\" Replied that shade of the Magnanimous, \"Thy soul attainted is with cowardice, Which many times a man encumbers so, It turns him back from honoured enterprise, As false sight doth a beast, when he is shy. That thou mayst free thee from this apprehension, I'll tell thee why I came, and what I heard At the first moment when I grieved for thee. Among those was I who are in suspense, And a fair, saintly Lady called to me In such wise, I besought her to command me. Her eyes where shining brighter than the Star; And she began to say, gentle and low, With voice angelical, in her own language: 'O spirit courteous of Mantua, Of whom the fame still in the world endures, And shall endure, long-lasting as the world; A friend of mine, and not the friend of fortune, Upon the desert slope is so impeded Upon his way, that he has turned through terror, And may, I fear, already be so lost, That I too late have risen to his succour, From that which I have heard of him in Heaven. Bestir thee now, and with thy speech ornate, And with what needful is for his release, Assist him so, that I may be consoled. 9 \nBeatrice am I, who do bid thee go; I come from there, where I would fain return; Love moved me, which compelleth me to speak. When I shall be in presence of my Lord, Full often will I praise thee unto him.' Then paused she, and thereafter I began: 'O Lady of virtue, thou alone through whom The human race exceedeth all contained Within the heaven that has the lesser circles, So grateful unto me is thy commandment, To obey, if 'twere already done, were late; No farther need'st thou ope to me thy wish. But the cause tell me why thou dost not shun The here descending down into this centre, From the vast place thou burnest to return to.' 'Since thou wouldst fain so inwardly discern, Briefly will I relate,' she answered me, 'Why I am not afraid to enter here. Of those things only should one be afraid Which have the power of doing others harm; Of the rest, no; because they are not fearful. God in his mercy such created me That misery of yours attains me not, Nor any flame assails me of this burning. A gentle Lady is in Heaven, who grieves At this impediment, to which I send thee, So that stern judgment there above is broken. In her entreaty she besought Lucia, And said, \"Thy faithful one now stands in need Of thee, and unto thee I recommend him.\" Lucia, foe of all that cruel is, Hastened away, and came unto the place Where I was sitting with the ancient Rachel. \"Beatrice\" said she, \"the true praise of God, Why succourest thou not him, who loved thee so, For thee he issued from the vulgar herd? Dost thou not hear the pity of his plaint? Dost thou not see the death that combats him Beside that flood, where ocean has no vaunt?\" Never were persons in the world so swift 10 \nTo work their weal and to escape their woe, As I, after such words as these were uttered, Came hither downward from my blessed seat, Confiding in thy dignified discourse, Which honours thee, and those who've listened to it.' After she thus had spoken unto me, Weeping, her shining eyes she turned away; Whereby she made me swifter in my coming; And unto thee I came, as she desired; I have delivered thee from that wild beast, Which barred the beautiful mountain's short ascent. What is it, then? Why, why dost thou delay? Why is such baseness bedded in thy heart? Daring and hardihood why hast thou not, Seeing that three such Ladies benedight Are caring for thee in the court of Heaven, And so much good my speech doth promise thee?\" Even as the flowerets, by nocturnal chill, Bowed down and closed, when the sun whitens them, Uplift themselves all open on their stems; Such I became with my exhausted strength, And such good courage to my heart there coursed, That I began, like an intrepid person: \"O she compassionate, who succoured me, And courteous thou, who hast obeyed so soon The words of truth which she addressed to thee! Thou hast my heart so with desire disposed To the adventure, with these words of thine, That to my first intent I have returned. Now go, for one sole will is in us both, Thou Leader, and thou Lord, and Master thou.\" Thus said I to him; and when he had moved, I entered on the deep and savage way. 11",
      "modern": "Day was ending, and the darkening air\nreleased all the earth's creatures\n\nAs evening fell and all living creatures found rest from their labors,\nI alone prepared myself to endure the battle—\nboth the struggle of the journey and the anguish it would bring,\nwhich my unfailing memory will now retrace.\n\nO Muses, O sublime genius, help me now!\nO memory that recorded what I witnessed,\nhere your true nobility shall shine forth!\n\nAnd I began: \"Poet, you who guide me,\nconsider whether my courage is sufficient\nbefore you entrust me to this terrible passage.\n\nYou tell me that Silvius's father,\nwhile still mortal and corruptible,\njourneyed to the immortal world in living flesh.\n\nYet if the Enemy of all evil showed such courtesy,\nconsidering the momentous consequences\nthat would flow from him—who he was and what he would become—\nthis seems fitting to any thinking person.\n\nFor he was chosen in highest heaven\nto be the father of noble Rome and her empire,\nboth of which, to speak truthfully,\nwere established as that sacred place\nwhere the successor of great Peter holds his throne.\n\nOn that journey you celebrate,\nhe heard prophecies that became the foundation\nof both his victory and the papal throne.\n\nLater, the Chosen Vessel also traveled there\nto bring back confirmation of that Faith\nwhich opens the path to salvation.\n\nBut why should I go there?

Justice incited my sublime Creator; Created me divine Omnipotence, The highest Wisdom and the primal Love. Before me there were no created things, Only eterne, and I eternal last. All hope abandon, ye who enter in!\" These words in sombre colour I beheld Written upon the summit of a gate; Whence I: \"Their sense is, Master, hard to me!\" And he to me, as one experienced: \"Here all suspicion needs must be abandoned, All cowardice must needs be here extinct. We to the place have come, where I have told thee Thou shalt behold the people dolorous Who have foregone the good of intellect.\" And after he had laid his hand on mine With joyful mien, whence I was comforted, He led me in among the secret things. There sighs, complaints, and ululations loud Resounded through the air without a star, Whence I, at the beginning, wept thereat. Languages diverse, horrible dialects, Accents of anger, words of agony, And voices high and hoarse, with sound of hands, Made up a tumult that goes whirling on 12 For ever in that air for ever black, Even as the sand doth, when the whirlwind breathes. And I, who had my head with horror bound, Said: \"Master, what is this which now I hear? What folk is this, which seems by pain so vanquished?\" And he to me: \"This miserable mode Maintain the melancholy souls of those Who lived withouten infamy or praise. Commingled are they with that caitiff choir Of Angels, who have not rebellious been, Nor faithful were to God, but were for self. The heavens expelled them, not to be less fair; Nor them the nethermore abyss receives, For glory none the damned would have from them.\" And I: \"O Master, what so grievous is To these, that maketh them lament so sore?\" He answered: \"I will tell thee very briefly. These have no longer any hope of death; And this blind life of theirs is so debased, They envious are of every other fate. No fame of them the world permits to be; Misericord and Justice both disdain them. Let us not speak of them, but look, and pass.\" And I, who looked again, beheld a banner, Which, whirling round, ran on so rapidly, That of all pause it seemed to me indignant; And after it there came so long a train Of people, that I ne'er would have believed That ever Death so many had undone. When some among them I had recognised, I looked, and I beheld the shade of him Who made through cowardice the great refusal. Forthwith I comprehended, and was certain, That this the sect was of the caitiff wretches Hateful to God and to his enemies. These miscreants, who never were alive, Were naked, and were stung exceedingly By gadflies and by hornets that were there. These did their faces irrigate with blood, Which, with their tears commingled, at their feet 13 \nBy the disgusting worms was gathered up. And when to gazing farther I betook me. People I saw on a great river's bank; Whence said I: \"Master, now vouchsafe to me, That I may know who these are, and what law Makes them appear so ready to pass over, As I discern athwart the dusky light.\" And he to me: \"These things shall all be known To thee, as soon as we our footsteps stay Upon the dismal shore of Acheron.\" Then with mine eyes ashamed and downward cast, Fearing my words might irksome be to him, From speech refrained I till we reached the river. And lo! towards us coming in a boat An old man, hoary with the hair of eld, Crying: \"Woe unto you, ye souls depraved! Hope nevermore to look upon the heavens; I come to lead you to the other shore, To the eternal shades in heat and frost. And thou, that yonder standest, living soul, Withdraw thee from these people, who are dead!\" But when he saw that I did not withdraw, He said: \"By other ways, by other ports Thou to the shore shalt come, not here, for passage; A lighter vessel needs must carry thee.\" And unto him the Guide: \"Vex thee not, Charon; It is so willed there where is power to do That which is willed; and farther question not.\" Thereat were quieted the fleecy cheeks Of him the ferryman of the livid fen, Who round about his eyes had wheels of flame. But all those souls who weary were and naked Their colour changed and gnashed their teeth together, As soon as they had heard those cruel words. God they blasphemed and their progenitors, The human race, the place, the time, the seed Of their engendering and of their birth! Thereafter all together they drew back, Bitterly weeping, to the accursed shore, Which waiteth every man who fears not God. 14 \nCharon the demon, with the eyes of glede, Beckoning to them, collects them all together, Beats with his oar whoever lags behind. As in the autumn-time the leaves fall off, First one and then another, till the branch Unto the earth surrenders all its spoils; In similar wise the evil seed of Adam Throw themselves from that margin one by one, At signals, as a bird unto its lure. So they depart across the dusky wave, And ere upon the other side they land, Again on this side a new troop assembles. \"My son,\" the courteous Master said to me, \"All those who perish in the wrath of God Here meet together out of every land; And ready are they to pass o'er the river, Because celestial Justice spurs them on, So that their fear is turned into desire. This way there never passes a good soul; And hence if Charon doth complain of thee, Well mayst thou know now what his speech imports.\" This being finished, all the dusk champaign Trembled so violently, that of that terror The recollection bathes me still with sweat. The land of tears gave forth a blast of wind, And fulminated a vermilion light, Which overmastered in me every sense, And as a man whom sleep hath seized I fell. 15",

Coming toward us in a boat\nWas an old man, his hair white with age,\nShouting: \"Woe to you, you corrupt souls!\nNever hope to see the heavens again!\nI come to ferry you to the other shore,\nInto eternal darkness, fire, and ice.\nAnd you there—you living soul—\nGet away from these dead ones!\"\n\nBut when he saw I didn't move,\nHe said: \"By other routes, through other gates\nYou'll reach the shore, not here.\nA lighter boat must carry you.\"\n\nMy guide answered him: \"Don't torment yourself, Charon.\nThis is willed where there is power\nTo do what is willed. Ask no more questions.\"\n\nAt this, the woolly cheeks fell silent\nOn the ferryman of the livid marsh,\nWho had wheels of flame around his eyes.\n\nBut all those weary, naked souls\nChanged color and gnashed their teeth\nAs soon as they heard his cruel words.\nThey cursed God and their parents,\nThe human race, the place, the time,\nThe seed of their conception and their birth.\n\nThen, weeping bitterly, they all gathered together\nOn the accursed shore\nThat awaits everyone who doesn't fear God.\n\nCharon the demon, with glowing eyes,\nSignals and collects them all,\nStrikes with his oar anyone who lingers.\n\nAs autumn leaves fall away,\nFirst one, then another, until the branch\nGives all its spoils to the earth,\nSo the evil seed of Adam\nThrows itself from that shore one by one\nAt his signals, like a bird to its call.\n\nThey depart across the dark water,\nAnd before they land on the other side,\nA new crowd assembles here again.\n\n\"My son,\" my courteous master said,\n\"All those who die in God's anger\nGather here from every country.\nThey are ready to cross the river\nBecause divine justice spurs them on,\nSo their fear transforms into desire.\nNo good soul ever passes this way,\nSo if Charon objects to you,\nNow you understand what he means.\"\n\nWhen he finished speaking, the dark plain\nTrembled so violently that the memory\nOf that terror still bathes me in sweat.\nThe land of tears sent forth a wind\nAnd flashed a crimson light\nThat overwhelmed all my senses,\nAnd I fell like someone seized by sleep.",

      "original": "Broke the deep lethargy within my head\nA heavy thunder, so that I upstarted,\nLike to a person who by force is wakened;\nAnd round about I moved my rested eyes,\nUprisen erect, and steadfastly I gazed,\nTo recognise the place wherein I was.\nTrue is it, that upon the verge I found me Of the abysmal valley dolorous, That gathers thunder of infinite ululations. Obscure, profound it was, and nebulous, So that by fixing on its depths my sight Nothing whatever I discerned therein. \"Let us descend now into the blind world,\" Began the Poet, pallid utterly; \"I will be first, and thou shalt second be.\" And I, who of his colour was aware, Said: \"How shall I come, if thou art afraid, Who'rt wont to be a comfort to my fears?\" And he to me: \"The anguish of the people Who are below here in my face depicts That pity which for terror thou hast taken. Let us go on, for the long way impels us.\" Thus he went in, and thus he made me enter The foremost circle that surrounds the abyss. There, as it seemed to me from listening, Were lamentations none, but only sighs, That tremble made the everlasting air. And this arose from sorrow without torment, 16 Which the crowds had, that many were and great, Of infants and of women and of men. To me the Master good: \"Thou dost not ask What spirits these, which thou beholdest, are? Now will I have thee know, ere thou go farther, That they sinned not; and if they merit had, 'Tis not enough, because they had not baptism Which is the portal of the Faith thou holdest; And if they were before Christianity, In the right manner they adored not God; And among such as these am I myself. For such defects, and not for other guilt, Lost are we and are only so far punished, That without hope we live on in desire.\" Great grief seized on my heart when this I heard, Because some people of much worthiness I knew, who in that Limbo were suspended. \"Tell me, my Master, tell me, thou my Lord,\" Began I, with desire of being certain Of that Faith which o'ercometh every error, \"Came any one by his own merit hence, Or by another's, who was blessed thereafter?\" And he, who understood my covert speech, Replied: \"I was a novice in this state, When I saw hither come a Mighty One, With sign of victory incoronate. Hence he drew forth the shade of the First Parent, And that of his son Abel, and of Noah, Of Moses the lawgiver, and the obedient Abraham, patriarch, and David, king, Israel with his father and his children, And Rachel, for whose sake he did so much, And others many, and he made them blessed; And thou must know, that earlier than these Never were any human spirits saved.\" We ceased not to advance because he spake, But still were passing onward through the forest, The forest, say I, of thick-crowded ghosts. Not very far as yet our way had gone This side the summit, when I saw a fire 17 \nThat overcame a hemisphere of darkness. We were a little distant from it still, But not so far that I in part discerned not That honourable people held that place. \"O thou who honourest every art and science, Who may these be, which such great honour have, That from the fashion of the rest it parts them?\" And he to me: \"The honourable name, That sounds of them above there in thy life, Wins grace in Heaven, that so advances them.\" In the mean time a voice was heard by me: \"All honour be to the pre-eminent Poet; His shade returns again, that was departed.\" After the voice had ceased and quiet was, Four mighty shades I saw approaching us; Semblance had they nor sorrowful nor glad. To say to me began my gracious Master: \"Him with that falchion in his hand behold, Who comes before the three, even as their lord. That one is Homer, Poet sovereign; He who comes next is Horace, the satirist; The third is Ovid, and the last is Lucan. Because to each of these with me applies The name that solitary voice proclaimed, They do me honour, and in that do well.\" Thus I beheld assemble the fair school Of that lord of the song pre-eminent, Who o'er the others like an eagle soars. When they together had discoursed somewhat, They turned to me with signs of salutation, And on beholding this, my Master smiled; And more of honour still, much more, they did me, In that they made me one of their own band; So that the sixth was I, 'mid so much wit. Thus we went on as far as to the light, Things saying 'tis becoming to keep silent, As was the saying of them where I was. We came unto a noble castle's foot, Seven times encompassed with lofty walls, Defended round by a fair rivulet; 18 \nThis we passed over even as firm ground; Through portals seven I entered with these Sages; We came into a meadow of fresh verdure. People were there with solemn eyes and slow, Of great authority in their countenance; They spake but seldom, and with gentle voices. Thus we withdrew ourselves upon one side Into an opening luminous and lofty, So that they all of them were visible. There opposite, upon the green enamel, Were pointed out to me the mighty spirits, Whom to have seen I feel myself exalted. I saw Electra with companions many, 'Mongst whom I knew both Hector and Aeneas, Caesar in armour with gerfalcon eyes; I saw Camilla and Penthesilea On the other side, and saw the King Latinus, Who with Lavinia his daughter sat; I saw that Brutus who drove Tarquin forth, Lucretia, Julia, Marcia, and Cornelia, And saw alone, apart, the Saladin. When I had lifted up my brows a little, The Master I beheld of those who know, Sit with his philosophic family. All gaze upon him, and all do him honour. There I beheld both Socrates and Plato, Who nearer him before the others stand; Democritus, who puts the world on chance, Diogenes, Anaxagoras, and Thales, Zeno, Empedocles, and Heraclitus; Of qualities I saw the good collector, Hight Dioscorides; and Orpheus saw I, Tully and Livy, and moral Seneca, Euclid, geometrician, and Ptolemy, Galen, Hippocrates, and Avicenna, Averroes, who the great Comment made. I cannot all of them pourtray in full, Because so drives me onward the long theme, That many times the word comes short of fact. The sixfold company in two divides; 19 \nAnother way my sapient Guide conducts me Forth from the quiet to the air that trembles; And to a place I come where nothing shines. 20",
      "modern": "A heavy thunder broke the deep sleep\nwithin my head, so that I started up\nlike someone forced awake.\n\nI moved my rested eyes all around,\nrising upright, and gazed steadily\nto recognize where I was.\n\nIt is true that I found myself standing at the edge\nof the abyss of sorrow,\nwhere infinite cries of anguish\ngather like thunder.\n\nDark it was, profound and clouded,\nso that when I strained my eyes\nto pierce its depths,\nI could make out nothing at all.\n\n\"Now we descend into the sightless world,\"\nmy guide began, his face gone pale.\n\"I will go first, and you will follow.\"\n\nSeeing his color drain away, I said:\n\"How can I go on if you're afraid—\nyou who have always been my comfort\nwhen fear overtakes me?\"\n\nHe answered: \"The anguish of the people\ntrapped below paints my face\nwith the compassion you mistake for terror.\nCome—the long journey calls us forward.\"\n\nSo he entered, and led me\ninto that first circle\nsurrounding the abyss.\n\nHere, from what I could hear,\nthere were no wails of pain,\nonly sighs that made\nthe eternal air tremble.\n\nThis came from sorrow without torment,\nfelt by crowds—vast and numberless—\nof children, women, and men.\n\nMy good teacher said: \"You don't ask\nwhat souls these are that you see?\nI want you to know, before we go further,\nthat these committed no sin.\nThough they had

of honor occupied that place.\n\n\"O you who honor every art and science,\nwho are these that command such respect\nthey're set apart from all the rest?\"\n\nHe answered: \"Their noble reputation,\nwhich echoes in your world above,\nwins Heaven's grace, advancing them here.\"\n\nThen I heard a voice cry out:\n\"Honor the supreme Poet!\nHis shade returns—the one who had departed.\"\n\nAfter the voice fell silent,\nI saw four great souls approaching us,\ntheir faces neither sad nor joyful.\n\nMy gracious teacher began:\n\"See him with the sword in his hand,\nwalking

briefly,\nthey turned to me with welcoming gestures,\nwhich made my teacher smile.\n\nThey honored me still more\nby making me one of their company—\nI became the sixth among such brilliance.\n\nWe walked together toward the light,\nspeaking of things\nbetter left unspoken here.\n\nWe came to the foot of a noble castle\nsurrounded seven times by high walls\nand defended by a lovely stream.\n\nWe crossed over as if on solid ground.\nThrough seven gates I entered with these sages\ninto a meadow of fresh grass.\n\nPeople were there with grave, slow-moving eyes,\ngreat authority in their

      "original": "Thus I descended out of the first circle Down to the second, that less space begirds, And so much greater dole, that goads to wailing. There standeth Minos horribly, and snarls; Examines the transgressions at the entrance; Judges, and sends according as he girds him. I say, that when the spirit evil-born Cometh before him, wholly it confesses; And this discriminator of transgressions Seeth what place in Hell is meet for it; Girds himself with his tail as many times As grades he wishes it should be thrust down. Always before him many of them stand; They go by turns each one unto the judgment; They speak, and hear, and then are downward hurled. \"O thou, that to this dolorous hostelry Comest,\" said Minos to me, when he saw me, Leaving the practice of so great an office, \"Look how thou enterest, and in whom thou trustest; Let not the portal's amplitude deceive thee.\" And unto him my Guide: \"Why criest thou too? Do not impede his journey fate-ordained; It is so willed there where is power to do That which is willed; and ask no further question.\" And now begin the dolesome notes to grow Audible unto me; now am I come There where much lamentation strikes upon me. I came into a place mute of all light, Which bellows as the sea does in a tempest, 21 If by opposing winds 't is combated. The infernal hurricane that never rests Hurtles the spirits onward in its rapine; Whirling them round, and smiting, it molests them. When they arrive before the precipice, There are the shrieks, the plaints, and the laments, There they blaspheme the puissance divine. I understood that unto such a torment The carnal malefactors were condemned, Who reason subjugate to appetite. And as the wings of starlings bear them on In the cold season in large band and full, So doth that blast the spirits maledict; It hither, thither, downward, upward, drives them; No hope doth comfort them for evermore, Not of repose, but even of lesser pain. And as the cranes go chanting forth their lays, Making in air a long line of themselves, So saw I coming, uttering lamentations, Shadows borne onward by the aforesaid stress. Whereupon said I: \"Master, who are those People, whom the black air so castigates?\" \"The first of those, of whom intelligence Thou fain wouldst have,\" then said he unto me, \"The empress was of many languages. To sensual vices she was so abandoned, That lustful she made licit in her law, To remove the blame to which she had been led. She is Semiramis, of whom we read That she succeeded Ninus, and was his spouse; She held the land which now the Sultan rules. The next is she who killed herself for love, And broke faith with the ashes of Sichaeus; Then Cleopatra the voluptuous.\" Helen I saw, for whom so many ruthless Seasons revolved; and saw the great Achilles, Who at the last hour combated with Love. Paris I saw, Tristan; and more than a thousand Shades did he name and point out with his finger, Whom Love had separated from our life. 22 \nAfter that I had listened to my Teacher, Naming the dames of eld and cavaliers, Pity prevailed, and I was nigh bewildered. And I began: \"O Poet, willingly Speak would I to those two, who go together, And seem upon the wind to be so light.\" And, he to me: \"Thou'lt mark, when they shall be Nearer to us; and then do thou implore them By love which leadeth them, and they will come.\" Soon as the wind in our direction sways them, My voice uplift I: \"O ye weary souls! Come speak to us, if no one interdicts it.\" As turtle-doves, called onward by desire, With open and steady wings to the sweet nest Fly through the air by their volition borne, So came they from the band where Dido is, Approaching us athwart the air malign, So strong was the affectionate appeal. \"O living creature gracious and benignant, Who visiting goest through the purple air Us, who have stained the world incarnadine, If were the King of the Universe our friend, We would pray unto him to give thee peace, Since thou hast pity on our woe perverse. Of what it pleases thee to hear and speak, That will we hear, and we will speak to you, While silent is the wind, as it is now. Sitteth the city, wherein I was born, Upon the sea-shore where the Po descends To rest in peace with all his retinue. Love, that on gentle heart doth swiftly seize, Seized this man for the person beautiful That was ta'en from me, and still the mode offends me. Love, that exempts no one beloved from loving, Seized me with pleasure of this man so strongly, That, as thou seest, it doth not yet desert me; Love has conducted us unto one death; Caina waiteth him who quenched our life!\" These words were borne along from them to us. As soon as I had heard those souls tormented, 23 \nI bowed my face, and so long held it down Until the Poet said to me: \"What thinkest?\" When I made answer, I began: \"Alas! How many pleasant thoughts, how much desire, Conducted these unto the dolorous pass!\" Then unto them I turned me, and I spake, And I began: \"Thine agonies, Francesca, Sad and compassionate to weeping make me. But tell me, at the time of those sweet sighs, By what and in what manner Love conceded, That you should know your dubious desires?\" And she to me: \"There is no greater sorrow Than to be mindful of the happy time In misery, and that thy Teacher knows. But, if to recognise the earliest root Of love in us thou hast so great desire, I will do even as he who weeps and speaks. One day we reading were for our delight Of Launcelot, how Love did him enthral. Alone we were and without any fear. Full many a time our eyes together drew That reading, and drove the colour from our faces; But one point only was it that o'ercame us. When as we read of the much-longed-for smile Being by such a noble lover kissed, This one, who ne'er from me shall be divided, Kissed me upon the mouth all palpitating. Galeotto was the book and he who wrote it. That day no farther did we read therein.\" And all the while one spirit uttered this, The other one did weep so, that, for pity, I swooned away as if I had been dying, And fell, even as a dead body falls. 24",
      "modern": "So I descended from the first circle\ndown to the second, which wraps around\na smaller space but holds much greater pain—\npain that drives souls to wail and cry out.\n\nThere stands Minos, terrible and snarling,\nexamining each transgression at the entrance.\nHe judges and dispatches souls according to how he wraps himself—\nhis tail coiling around his body once for each circle\nhe wills the spirit to descend.\n\nAlways a crowd waits before him.\nThey approach his judgment one by one,\nconfess their sins, hear their sentence,\nthen are hurled downward into darkness.\n\n\"You who enter this house of suffering,\"\nMinos said when he saw me,\npausing his great work of condemnation,\n\"watch how you enter and whom you trust.\nDon't let the wide gate deceive you.\"\n\nMy guide answered: \"Why do you cry out?\nDon't obstruct his fated journey.\nThis is willed where power exists\nto accomplish what is willed.

I have arrived\nwhere endless lamentation strikes me.\nI entered a place stripped of all light\nthat roars like a storm-tossed sea\nwhen opposing winds battle above it.\n\nThe hellish hurricane that never stops\nsweeps spirits onward in its violence,\nwhirling and battering them without mercy.\nWhen they're hurled before the ruined cliff\nthere are shrieks, complaints, and wailing.\nThere they curse the divine power.\n\nI understood that souls condemned to this torment\nwere those who made reason slave to desire,\nwho surrendered mind to flesh.\n\nLike starlings carried on their wings\nin the cold season, in vast, dense flocks,\nso that wind drives the evil spirits—\nhere, there, down, up it carries them.\nNo hope ever comforts them,\nnot for rest, not even for lesser pain.\n\nAnd like cranes that form a long line\nacross the sky, singing their harsh song,\nso I saw coming, uttering lamentations,\nshadows borne along by that relentless storm.\n\n\"Master,\" I said, \"who are these people\nthat the black air punishes so?\"\n\n\"The first of those you want to know about,\"\nhe said, \"ruled an empire of many tongues.\nShe was so given over to sensual vice\nthat she made lust legal by decree\nto cover her own shame.\nThis is Semiramis, who succeeded Ninus as his wife\nand ruled the land the Sultan now controls.\n\nNext is she who killed herself for love\nand betrayed her vow to Sichaeus's ashes—\nvoluptuous Cleopatra comes after.\"\n\nI saw Helen, for whom so many ruthless years turned,\nand great Achilles, who fought with Love at the end.\nI saw Paris, Tristan, and more than a thousand shades\nhe named and pointed to with his finger—\nsouls whom Love had torn from life.\n\nAfter hearing my teacher name\nthose ancient ladies and knights,\npity overwhelmed me and I nearly fainted.\n\nI began: \"Poet, I would gladly speak\nto those two who move together\nand seem so light upon the wind.\"\n\nHe said: \"Watch when they drift nearer,\nthen call to them by the love that leads them,\nand they will come.\"\n\nAs soon as the wind swept them toward us\nI raised my voice: \"Tormented souls,\ncome speak with us, if nothing forbids it.\"\n\nLike doves called by desire\nflying with steady, open wings\ntoward their sweet nest through willing air,\nso they came from Dido's company,\napproaching through the malignant atmosphere—\nso strong was my compassionate call.\n\n\"Living soul, gracious and kind,\nwho travels through this purple air\nto visit us who stained the world blood-red:\nif the King of the universe were our friend\nwe would pray to him for your peace,\nsince you take pity on our twisted suffering.\n\nWhatever you wish to hear and speak,\nwe will hear and speak with you\nwhile the wind stays silent as it is now.\n\nThe city where I was born\nsits by the seashore where the Po descends\nto find peace with all its tributaries.\n\nLove, which quickly seizes any gentle heart,\ntook this man with passion for the beautiful body\nthat was torn from me—the manner still wounds me.\n\nLove, which allows no beloved not to love in return,\ngripped me with such delight in him\nthat, as you see, it never leaves me still.\n\nLove led us both to the same death.\nCaina awaits the one who killed us.\"\n\nThese words drifted to us from them.\n\nWhen I heard those tormented souls\nI bowed my head and held it down so long\nthe poet asked: \"What are you thinking?\"\n\nWhen I answered, I began: \"Alas,\nhow many sweet thoughts, how much longing\nbrought them to this grievous end.\"\n\nThen I turned back to them and spoke:\n\"Francesca, your suffering\nmakes me weep with sadness and compassion.\nBut tell me: in the time of sweet sighs,\nhow did Love reveal to you\nyour dangerous desires?\"\n\nShe answered: \"There is no greater sorrow\nthan remembering happiness\nin times of misery—your teacher knows this well.\n\nBut if you have such desire to know\nthe first root of our love,\nI will tell it like one who weeps while speaking.\n\nOne day, for pleasure, we were reading\nabout Lancelot and how Love conquered him.\nWe were alone and suspected nothing.\n\nMany times that reading made our eyes meet\nand drained the color from our faces,\nbut one moment alone defeated us:\n\nWhen we read how that longed-for smile\nwas kissed by such a perfect lover,\nthis one, who will never be parted from me,\nkissed my trembling mouth.\n\nThe book was our Galeotto, and so was he who wrote it.\nThat day we read no further.\"\n\nWhile one spirit spoke these words\nthe other wept so hard that out of pity\nI fainted as if dying,\nand fell like a dead body falls.",

In the third circle am I of the rain Eternal, maledict, and cold, and heavy; Its law and quality are never new. Huge hail, and water sombre-hued, and snow, Athwart the tenebrous air pour down amain; Noisome the earth is, that receiveth this. Cerberus, monster cruel and uncouth, With his three gullets like a dog is barking Over the people that are there submerged. Red eyes he has, and unctuous beard and black, And belly large, and armed with claws his hands; He rends the spirits, flays, and quarters them. Howl the rain maketh them like unto dogs; One side they make a shelter for the other; Oft turn themselves the wretched reprobates. When Cerberus perceived us, the great worm! His mouths he opened, and displayed his tusks; Not a limb had he that was motionless. And my Conductor, with his spans extended, Took of the earth, and with his fists well filled, He threw it into those rapacious gullets. Such as that dog is, who by barking craves, And quiet grows soon as his food he gnaws, 25 For to devour it he but thinks and struggles, The like became those muzzles filth-begrimed Of Cerberus the demon, who so thunders Over the souls that they would fain be deaf. We passed across the shadows, which subdues The heavy rain-storm, and we placed our feet Upon their vanity that person seems. They all were lying prone upon the earth, Excepting one, who sat upright as soon As he beheld us passing on before him. \"O thou that art conducted through this Hell,\" He said to me, \"recall me, if thou canst; Thyself wast made before I was unmade.\" And I to him: \"The anguish which thou hast Perhaps doth draw thee out of my remembrance, So that it seems not I have ever seen thee. But tell me who thou art, that in so doleful A place art put, and in such punishment, If some are greater, none is so displeasing.\" And he to me: \"Thy city, which is full Of envy so that now the sack runs over, Held me within it in the life serene. You citizens were wont to call me Ciacco; For the pernicious sin of gluttony I, as thou seest, am battered by this rain. And I, sad soul, am not the only one, For all these suffer the like penalty For the like sin;\" and word no more spake he. I answered him: \"Ciacco, thy wretchedness Weighs on me so that it to weep invites me; But tell me, if thou knowest, to what shall come The citizens of the divided city; If any there be just; and the occasion Tell me why so much discord has assailed it.\" And he to me: \"They, after long contention, Will come to bloodshed; and the rustic party Will drive the other out with much offence. Then afterwards behoves it this one fall Within three suns, and rise again the other By force of him who now is on the coast. 26 \nHigh will it hold its forehead a long while, Keeping the other under heavy burdens, Howe'er it weeps thereat and is indignant. The just are two, and are not understood there; Envy and Arrogance and Avarice Are the three sparks that have all hearts enkindled.\" Here ended he his tearful utterance; And I to him: \"I wish thee still to teach me, And make a gift to me of further speech. Farinata and Tegghiaio, once so worthy, Jacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca, And others who on good deeds set their thoughts, Say where they are, and cause that I may know them; For great desire constraineth me to learn If Heaven doth sweeten them, or Hell envenom.\" And he: \"They are among the blacker souls; A different sin downweighs them to the bottom; If thou so far descendest, thou canst see them. But when thou art again in the sweet world, I pray thee to the mind of others bring me; No more I tell thee and no more I answer.\" Then his straightforward eyes he turned askance, Eyed me a little, and then bowed his head; He fell therewith prone like the other blind. And the Guide said to me: \"He wakes no more This side the sound of the angelic trumpet; When shall approach the hostile Potentate, Each one shall find again his dismal tomb, Shall reassume his flesh and his own figure, Shall hear what through eternity re-echoes.\" So we passed onward o'er the filthy mixture Of shadows and of rain with footsteps slow, Touching a little on the future life. Wherefore I said: \"Master, these torments here, Will they increase after the mighty sentence, Or lesser be, or will they be as burning?\" And he to me: \"Return unto thy science, Which wills, that as the thing more perfect is, The more it feels of pleasure and of pain. Albeit that this people maledict 27 \nTo true perfection never can attain, Hereafter more than now they look to be.\" Round in a circle by that road we went, Speaking much more, which I do not repeat; We came unto the point where the descent is; There we found Plutus the great enemy. 28",
      "modern": "When consciousness returned—\nit had fled before the pity I felt\nfor those two lovers,\nleaving me overwhelmed with grief—\n\nI see new torments and new sufferers\nall around me,\nwherever I move,\nwherever I turn and look.\n\nHere I am in the third circle, where eternal rain falls—\ncursed, cold, and heavy, never changing its cruel law.\nMassive hail and dark water and snow\npour down through the murky air without end.\nThe earth reeks as it receives this deluge.\n\nCerberus, that cruel and hideous monster,\nbarks with three throats like a rabid dog\nover the people submerged here.\nHis eyes burn red, his beard drips black and oily,\nhis belly swells enormous, his hands bristle with claws.\nHe tears the spirits apart, flays them, rips them to pieces.\n\nThe rain makes them howl like dogs.\nThey try to shield each other with their bodies,\nthese wretched damned souls, turning constantly in the mire.\n\nWhen Cerberus saw us—that great worm!—\nhe opened all his mouths and showed his fangs.\nNot one part of him stayed still.\nBut my guide stretched out his hands,\ngrabbed fistfuls of the putrid earth,\nand hurled it down those ravenous gullets.\n\nLike a dog that barks and begs for food,\nthen falls quiet once he gets something to gnaw,\nthinking only of devouring what he has—\nso those filthy, thundering muzzles of demon Cerberus\nfell silent, though the souls still wished they could go deaf\nfrom his terrible roaring.\n\nWe walked across these shadows\nbeaten down by the heavy storm,\nstepping on what seemed like bodies but was only emptiness.\nAll of them lay flat against the ground\nexcept for one, who sat up straight\nas soon as he saw us passing by.\n\n\"You who are being led through this Hell,\"\nhe said to me, \"remember me if you can.\nYou were created before I was destroyed.\"\n\n\"Your suffering,\" I answered him,\n\"may have erased you from my memory—\nI don't think I've ever seen you before.\nBut tell me who you are, placed in this miserable place\nwith such punishment that, though others may be worse,\nnone could be more disgusting.\"\n\n\"Your city, so full of envy\nthat the sack overflows,\" he said,\n\"held me in the peaceful life above.\nYou citizens used to call me Ciacco.\nFor the destructive sin of gluttony,\nas you can see, I'm battered by this rain.\nAnd I'm not the only miserable soul here—\nall these others suffer the same penalty\nfor the same sin.\" Then he said no more.\n\n\"Ciacco,\" I answered, \"your wretchedness\nweighs on me so heavily it makes me want to weep.\nBut tell me, if you know—what will happen\nto the citizens of our divided city?\nIs there anyone just there? And tell me\nwhy so much discord has torn it apart.\"\n\n\"After long struggle,\" he said,\n\"they'll come to bloodshed. The country party\nwill drive out the other with great violence.\nBut then within three years that side will fall,\nand the other will rise again\nthrough the power of one who now waits on the sidelines.\nThey'll hold their heads high for a long time,\nkeeping their enemies under heavy burdens,\nno matter how much the others weep and rage.\nOnly two men are just, and no one listens to them.\nEnvy and pride and greed—\nthese are the three sparks that have set every heart on fire.\"\n\nHere he ended his tearful speech.\n\"I want you to teach me more,\" I said,\n\"and give me the gift of further words.\nFarinata and Tegghiaio, who were so worthy,\nJacopo Rusticucci, Arrigo, and Mosca,\nand the others who set their minds on doing good—\ntell me where they are, help me to know them.\nI'm desperate to learn whether Heaven sweetens them\nor Hell poisons them.\"\n\n\"They're among the blacker souls,\" he said.\n\"Different sins drag them down to the bottom.\nIf you descend that far, you can see them.\nBut when you return to the sweet world,\nplease bring me back to others' memory.\nI'll tell you no more and answer nothing else.\"\n\nHis eyes, which had looked straight at me, turned aside.\nHe glanced at me briefly, then bowed his head\nand fell face-down like all the other blind souls.\n\n\"He won't wake again,\" my guide said,\n\"until the angel's trumpet sounds,\nwhen the hostile Judge approaches.\nEach soul will find his wretched tomb again,\ntake back his flesh and human shape,\nand hear what echoes through eternity.\"\n\nWe moved on across that filthy mixture\nof shadows and rain with slow steps,\ntalking a little about the life to come.\n\"Master,\" I said, \"will these torments\nincrease after the great judgment,\nor lessen, or stay just as intense?\"\n\n\"Go back to your philosophy,\" he answered,\n\"which teaches that the more perfect something is,\nthe more it feels both pleasure and pain.\nThough these cursed people can never reach\ntrue perfection, they'll be more complete\nafter that day than they are now.\"\n\nWe walked in a circle along that path,\nsaying much more than I won't repeat here,\nuntil we came to the place of descent.\nThere we found Plutus, the great enemy.",

      "original": "\"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!\" Thus Plutus with his clucking voice began; And that benignant Sage, who all things knew, Said, to encourage me: \"Let not thy fear Harm thee; for any power that he may have Shall not prevent thy going down this crag.\" Then he turned round unto that bloated lip, And said: \"Be silent, thou accursed wolf; Consume within thyself with thine own rage. Not causeless is this journey to the abyss; Thus is it willed on high, where Michael wrought Vengeance upon the proud adultery.\" Even as the sails inflated by the wind Involved together fall when snaps the mast, So fell the cruel monster to the earth. Thus we descended into the fourth chasm, Gaining still farther on the dolesome shore Which all the woe of the universe insacks. Justice of God, ah! who heaps up so many New toils and sufferings as I beheld? And why doth our transgression waste us so? As doth the billow there upon Charybdis, That breaks itself on that which it encounters, So here the folk must dance their roundelay. Here saw I people, more than elsewhere, many, On one side and the other, with great howls, Rolling weights forward by main force of chest. They clashed together, and then at that point 29 Each one turned backward, rolling retrograde, Crying, \"Why keepest?\" and, \"Why squanderest thou?\" Thus they returned along the lurid circle On either hand unto the opposite point, Shouting their shameful metre evermore. Then each, when he arrived there, wheeled about Through his half-circle to another joust; And I, who had my heart pierced as it were, Exclaimed: \"My Master, now declare to me What people these are, and if all were clerks, These shaven crowns upon the left of us.\" And he to me: \"All of them were asquint In intellect in the first life, so much That there with measure they no spending made. Clearly enough their voices bark it forth, Whene'er they reach the two points of the circle, Where sunders them the opposite defect. Clerks those were who no hairy covering Have on the head, and Popes and Cardinals, In whom doth Avarice practise its excess.\" And I: \"My Master, among such as these I ought forsooth to recognise some few, Who were infected with these maladies.\" And he to me: \"Vain thought thou entertainest; The undiscerning life which made them sordid Now makes them unto all discernment dim. Forever shall they come to these two buttings; These from the sepulchre shall rise again With the fist closed, and these with tresses shorn. Ill giving and ill keeping the fair world Have ta'en from them, and placed them in this scuffle; Whate'er it be, no words adorn I for it. Now canst thou, Son, behold the transient farce Of goods that are committed unto Fortune, For which the human race each other buffet; For all the gold that is beneath the moon, Or ever has been, of these weary souls Could never make a single one repose.\" \"Master,\" I said to him, \"now tell me also What is this Fortune which thou speakest of, 30 \nThat has the world's goods so within its clutches?\" And he to me: \"O creatures imbecile, What ignorance is this which doth beset you? Now will I have thee learn my judgment of her. He whose omniscience everything transcends The heavens created, and gave who should guide them, That every part to every part may shine, Distributing the light in equal measure; He in like manner to the mundane splendours Ordained a general ministress and guide, That she might change at times the empty treasures From race to race, from one blood to another, Beyond resistance of all human wisdom. Therefore one people triumphs, and another Languishes, in pursuance of her judgment, Which hidden is, as in the grass a serpent. Your knowledge has no counterstand against her; She makes provision, judges, and pursues Her governance, as theirs the other gods. Her permutations have not any truce; Necessity makes her precipitate, So often cometh who his turn obtains. And this is she who is so crucified Even by those who ought to give her praise, Giving her blame amiss, and bad repute. But she is blissful, and she hears it not; Among the other primal creatures gladsome She turns her sphere, and blissful she rejoices. Let us descend now unto greater woe; Already sinks each star that was ascending When I set out, and loitering is forbidden.\" We crossed the circle to the other bank, Near to a fount that boils, and pours itself Along a gully that runs out of it. The water was more sombre far than perse; And we, in company with the dusky waves, Made entrance downward by a path uncouth. A marsh it makes, which has the name of Styx, This tristful brooklet, when it has descended Down to the foot of the malign gray shores. 31 \nAnd I, who stood intent upon beholding, Saw people mud-besprent in that lagoon, All of them naked and with angry look. They smote each other not alone with hands, But with the head and with the breast and feet, Tearing each other piecemeal with their teeth. Said the good Master: \"Son, thou now beholdest The souls of those whom anger overcame; And likewise I would have thee know for certain Beneath the water people are who sigh And make this water bubble at the surface, As the eye tells thee wheresoe'er it turns. Fixed in the mire they say, 'We sullen were In the sweet air, which by the sun is gladdened, Bearing within ourselves the sluggish reek; Now we are sullen in this sable mire.' This hymn do they keep gurgling in their throats, For with unbroken words they cannot say it.\" Thus we went circling round the filthy fen A great arc 'twixt the dry bank and the swamp, With eyes turned unto those who gorge the mire; Unto the foot of a tower we came at last. 32",
      "modern": "\"Pape Satan, Pape Satan, Aleppe!\"\nSo Plutus began with his harsh, clucking voice.\n\nAnd my wise guide, who understood all things,\nspoke to encourage me: \"Don't let\n\n\"Do not let fear harm you; whatever power he possesses\ncannot prevent you from descending this rocky slope.\"\nThen he turned toward that swollen, bloated face\nand said: \"Be silent, you cursed wolf!\nLet your own rage consume you from within.\nThis journey to the abyss is not without cause—\nit is willed from on high, where Michael\nbrought vengeance upon the proud rebellion.\"\n\nLike sails swollen by wind\nthat collapse together when the mast snaps,\nso the cruel monster fell to earth.\nThus we descended into the fourth circle,\nmoving further along that sorrowful shore\nwhich holds all the world's suffering.\n\nOh Justice of God! Who heaps up\nso many fresh torments and punishments as I witnessed?\nAnd why does our sin destroy us so completely?\n\nLike waves crashing against Charybdis,\nbreaking themselves on what they strike,\nhere the souls must dance their eternal round.\nI saw more people here than anywhere else,\non both sides, howling with tremendous cries,\nusing their chests to roll great weights forward.\n\nThey crashed together, and at that point\neach turned backward, rolling in reverse,\nshouting \"Why do you hoard?\" and \"Why do you waste?\"\nSo they moved along the dark circle\non either side to the opposite point,\nscreaming their shameful refrain forever.\n\nWhen each arrived there, he wheeled around\nthrough his half-circle to clash again.\nAnd I, my heart pierced with sorrow,\ncried out: \"My master, explain to me—\nwho are these people? Were all those\nwith shaven heads on our left clergy?\"\n\nHe answered: \"All of them were so twisted\nin mind during their first life\nthat they spent without any measure.\nTheir voices bark this truth clearly enough\nwhen they reach the two points of the circle\nwhere opposite sins divide them.\n\nThose without hair covering their heads\nwere clergy—popes and cardinals\nin whom greed practiced its worst excess.\"\n\n\"Master,\" I said, \"among people like these\nI should surely recognize some\nwho were infected with these diseases.\"\n\n\"You entertain a useless thought,\" he replied.\n\"The unthinking life that made them filthy\nnow makes them beyond all recognition.\nForever they will come to these collisions—\nthese will rise from their graves with fists clenched,\nthose others with their hair shorn off.\n\nPoor giving and poor keeping have stolen\nthe beautiful world from them\nand set them in this brawl—\nI won't waste pretty words describing it.\nNow you can see, my son, the fleeting comedy\nof goods entrusted to Fortune,\nfor which humanity battles one another.\nAll the gold that lies beneath the moon,\nor ever existed, could not give\na moment's rest to even one of these weary souls.\"\n\n\"Master,\" I said, \"now tell me also—\nwhat is this Fortune you speak of\nthat holds the world's wealth so tightly in its grip?\"\n\n\"Oh foolish creatures,\" he answered,\n\"what ignorance surrounds you!\nNow let me teach you my understanding of her.\n\nHe whose wisdom transcends all things\ncreated the heavens and gave them guides\nso every part might shine upon every other part,\ndistributing light equally.\nIn the same way, for worldly splendors\nhe appointed a general minister and guide\nto transfer empty treasures from time to time\nfrom people to people, from one bloodline to another,\nbeyond all human wisdom's resistance.\n\nTherefore one nation triumphs while another\nlanguishes, following her judgment\nwhich remains hidden like a snake in grass.\nYour knowledge cannot stand against her—\nshe provides, judges, and pursues\nher rule as the other gods pursue theirs.\nHer changes know no rest;\nnecessity makes her swift—\nso often comes whoever's turn arrives.\n\nThis is she who is so crucified\neven by those who should praise her,\nwrongly blaming her with evil reputation.\nBut she is blessed and does not hear it;\namong the other primal creatures, joyful,\nshe turns her sphere and rejoices in her blessedness.\n\nLet us now descend to greater woe—\nalready every star that was rising when I departed\nis setting, and we must not linger.\"\n\nWe crossed the circle to the other shore,\nnear a spring that boils and pours itself\nalong a channel flowing out from it.\nThe water was far darker than deep purple,\nand we, accompanying the murky waves,\nentered downward by a strange path.\n\nThis melancholy stream forms a marsh\ncalled Styx when it has descended\nto the foot of the evil gray shores.\nStanding there, intent on watching,\nI saw people covered in mud in that lagoon,\nall naked and with furious expressions.\n\nThey struck each other not just with hands\nbut with heads and chests and feet,\ntearing each other apart with their teeth.\nThe good master said: \"Son, now you see\nthe souls of those whom anger conquered.\nAnd I want you to know for certain\nthat beneath the water are people who sigh\nand make this water bubble at the surface,\nas your eye can see wherever it looks.\n\nStuck in the slime they say: 'We were sullen\nin the sweet air gladdened by the sun,\ncarrying within ourselves a sluggish smoke;\nnow we are sullen in this black mire.'\nThis hymn they keep gurgling in their throats\nbecause they cannot speak it in clear words.\"\n\nSo we walked in a great arc around the filthy swamp\nbetween the dry bank and the bog,\nour eyes turned toward those who swallow mud,\nuntil we came at last to the foot of a tower.",

      "original": "I say, continuing, that long before We to the foot of that high tower had come, Our eyes went upward to the summit of it, By reason of two flamelets we saw placed there, And from afar another answer them, So far, that hardly could the eye attain it. And, to the sea of all discernment turned, I said: \"What sayeth this, and what respondeth That other fire? and who are they that made it?\" And he to me: \"Across the turbid waves What is expected thou canst now discern, If reek of the morass conceal it not.\" Cord never shot an arrow from itself That sped away athwart the air so swift, As I beheld a very little boat Come o'er the water tow'rds us at that moment, Under the guidance of a single pilot, Who shouted, \"Now art thou arrived, fell soul?\" \"Phlegyas, Phlegyas, thou criest out in vain For this once,\" said my Lord; \"thou shalt not have us Longer than in the passing of the slough.\" As he who listens to some great deceit That has been done to him, and then resents it, Such became Phlegyas, in his gathered wrath. My Guide descended down into the boat, And then he made me enter after him, And only when I entered seemed it laden. Soon as the Guide and I were in the boat, The antique prow goes on its way, dividing 33 More of the water than 'tis wont with others. While we were running through the dead canal, Uprose in front of me one full of mire, And said, \"Who 'rt thou that comest ere the hour?\" And I to him: \"Although I come, I stay not; But who art thou that hast become so squalid?\" \"Thou seest that I am one who weeps,\" he answered. And I to him: \"With weeping and with wailing, Thou spirit maledict, do thou remain; For thee I know, though thou art all defiled.\" Then stretched he both his hands unto the boat; Whereat my wary Master thrust him back, Saying, \"Away there with the other dogs!\" Thereafter with his arms he clasped my neck; He kissed my face, and said: \"Disdainful soul, Blessed be she who bore thee in her bosom. That was an arrogant person in the world; Goodness is none, that decks his memory; So likewise here his shade is furious. How many are esteemed great kings up there, Who here shall be like unto swine in mire, Leaving behind them horrible dispraises!\" And I: \"My Master, much should I be pleased, If I could see him soused into this broth, Before we issue forth out of the lake.\" And he to me: \"Ere unto thee the shore Reveal itself, thou shalt be satisfied; Such a desire 'tis meet thou shouldst enjoy.\" A little after that, I saw such havoc Made of him by the people of the mire, That still I praise and thank my God for it. They all were shouting, \"At Philippo Argenti!\" And that exasperate spirit Florentine Turned round upon himself with his own teeth. We left him there, and more of him I tell not; But on mine ears there smote a lamentation, Whence forward I intent unbar mine eyes. And the good Master said: \"Even now, my Son, The city draweth near whose name is Dis, With the grave citizens, with the great throng.\" 34 \nAnd I: \"Its mosques already, Master, clearly Within there in the valley I discern Vermilion, as if issuing from the fire They were.\" And he to me: \"The fire eternal That kindles them within makes them look red, As thou beholdest in this nether Hell.\" Then we arrived within the moats profound, That circumvallate that disconsolate city; The walls appeared to me to be of iron. Not without making first a circuit wide, We came unto a place where loud the pilot Cried out to us, \"Debark, here is the entrance.\" More than a thousand at the gates I saw Out of the Heavens rained down, who angrily Were saying, \"Who is this that without death Goes through the kingdom of the people dead?\" And my sagacious Master made a sign Of wishing secretly to speak with them. A little then they quelled their great disdain, And said: \"Come thou alone, and he begone Who has so boldly entered these dominions. Let him return alone by his mad road; Try, if he can; for thou shalt here remain, Who hast escorted him through such dark regions.\" Think, Reader, if I was discomforted At utterance of the accursed words; For never to return here I believed. \"O my dear Guide, who more than seven times Hast rendered me security, and drawn me From imminent peril that before me stood, Do not desert me,\" said I, \"thus undone; And if the going farther be denied us, Let us retrace our steps together swiftly.\" And that Lord, who had led me thitherward, Said unto me: \"Fear not; because our passage None can take from us, it by Such is given. But here await me, and thy weary spirit Comfort and nourish with a better hope; For in this nether world I will not leave thee.\" So onward goes and there abandons me 35 \nMy Father sweet, and I remain in doubt, For No and Yes within my head contend. I could not hear what he proposed to them; But with them there he did not linger long, Ere each within in rivalry ran back. They closed the portals, those our adversaries, On my Lord's breast, who had remained without And turned to me with footsteps far between. His eyes cast down, his forehead shorn had he Of all its boldness, and he said, with sighs, \"Who has denied to me the dolesome houses?\" And unto me: \"Thou, because I am angry, Fear not, for I will conquer in the trial, Whatever for defence within be planned. This arrogance of theirs is nothing new; For once they used it at less secret gate, Which finds itself without a fastening still. O'er it didst thou behold the dead inscription; And now this side of it descends the steep, Passing across the circles without escort, One by whose means the city shall be opened.\" 36",

Such a wish\ndeserves to be fulfilled.\"\n\nSoon after, I watched the muddy souls\nmake such havoc of him that I still\npraise and thank God for what I saw.\nThey all screamed: \"Get Filippo Argenti!\"\nAnd that enraged Florentine spirit\nturned his teeth upon himself.\nWe left him there—I'll say no more—\nbut cries of anguish struck my ears,\nand I strained my eyes ahead.\n\n\"Now, my son,\" my good master said,\n\"the city approaches whose name is Dis,\nwith its grave citizens and great host.\"\n\"Master, I can already see its towers\nrising red from the valley there,\nas if they were forged in fire.\"\n\"The eternal flames burning within\nmake them glow red,\" he told me,\n\"as you see here in this lower Hell.\"\n\nWe came at last to the deep moats\nthat circle that city of despair.\nThe walls seemed made of iron.\nAfter sailing a wide circuit,\nwe reached a place where the pilot\ncried out: \"Disembark! Here's the entrance!\"\n\nAbove the gates I saw more than a thousand\nof those rained down from Heaven, who said angrily:\n\"Who is this who, without dying,\ntravels through the kingdom of the dead?\"\nMy wise master made a gesture\nshowing he wished to speak with them privately.\n\nThey lowered their great scorn a little and said:\n\"You come alone, and let him go—\nthe one who dared enter this domain.\nLet him find his own mad way back if he can.\nYou will stay here, you who have guided him\nthrough such dark regions.\"\n\nThink, reader, how I felt\nat the sound of those cursed words—\nI believed I would never return from here.\n\"My dear guide,\" I said, \"you who have given me\nsafety more than seven times,\nwho have pulled me back from dangers that loomed before me,\ndon't abandon me in this ruin.\nIf we can't go forward,\nlet's quickly retrace our steps together.\"\n\nThat lord who had led me there\nsaid to me: \"Don't be afraid.\nNo one can take away our passage—\nit was granted by such authority.\nWait here for me, and comfort your weary spirit\nwith better hope.

He stopped attentive, like a man who listens, Because the eye could not conduct him far Through the black air, and through the heavy fog. \"Still it behoveth us to win the fight,\" Began he; \"Else… Such offered us herself… O how I long that some one here arrive!\" Well I perceived, as soon as the beginning He covered up with what came afterward, That they were words quite different from the first; But none the less his saying gave me fear, Because I carried out the broken phrase, Perhaps to a worse meaning than he had. \"Into this bottom of the doleful conch Doth any e'er descend from the first grade, Which for its pain has only hope cut off?\" This question put I; and he answered me: \"Seldom it comes to pass that one of us Maketh the journey upon which I go. True is it, once before I here below Was conjured by that pitiless Erictho, Who summoned back the shades unto their bodies. Naked of me short while the flesh had been, Before within that wall she made me enter, To bring a spirit from the circle of Judas; That is the lowest region and the darkest, And farthest from the heaven which circles all. 37 Well know I the way; therefore be reassured. This fen, which a prodigious stench exhales, Encompasses about the city dolent, Where now we cannot enter without anger.\" And more he said, but not in mind I have it; Because mine eye had altogether drawn me Tow'rds the high tower with the red-flaming summit, Where in a moment saw I swift uprisen The three infernal Furies stained with blood, Who had the limbs of women and their mien, And with the greenest hydras were begirt; Small serpents and cerastes were their tresses, Wherewith their horrid temples were entwined. And he who well the handmaids of the Queen Of everlasting lamentation knew, Said unto me: \"Behold the fierce Erinnys. This is Megaera, on the left-hand side; She who is weeping on the right, Alecto; Tisiphone is between;\" and then was silent. Each one her breast was rending with her nails; They beat them with their palms, and cried so loud, That I for dread pressed close unto the Poet. \"Medusa come, so we to stone will change him!\" All shouted looking down; \"in evil hour Avenged we not on Theseus his assault!\" \"Turn thyself round, and keep thine eyes close shut, For if the Gorgon appear, and thou shouldst see it, No more returning upward would there be.\" Thus said the Master; and he turned me round Himself, and trusted not unto my hands So far as not to blind me with his own. O ye who have undistempered intellects, Observe the doctrine that conceals itself Beneath the veil of the mysterious verses! And now there came across the turbid waves The clangour of a sound with terror fraught, Because of which both of the margins trembled; Not otherwise it was than of a wind Impetuous on account of adverse heats, That smites the forest, and, without restraint, 38 \nThe branches rends, beats down, and bears away; Right onward, laden with dust, it goes superb, And puts to flight the wild beasts and the shepherds. Mine eyes he loosed, and said: \"Direct the nerve Of vision now along that ancient foam, There yonder where that smoke is most intense.\" Even as the frogs before the hostile serpent Across the water scatter all abroad, Until each one is huddled in the earth. More than a thousand ruined souls I saw, Thus fleeing from before one who on foot Was passing o'er the Styx with soles unwet. From off his face he fanned that unctuous air, Waving his left hand oft in front of him, And only with that anguish seemed he weary. Well I perceived one sent from Heaven was he, And to the Master turned; and he made sign That I should quiet stand, and bow before him. Ah! how disdainful he appeared to me! He reached the gate, and with a little rod He opened it, for there was no resistance. \"O banished out of Heaven, people despised!\" Thus he began upon the horrid threshold; \"Whence is this arrogance within you couched? Wherefore recalcitrate against that will, From which the end can never be cut off, And which has many times increased your pain? What helpeth it to butt against the fates? Your Cerberus, if you remember well, For that still bears his chin and gullet peeled.\" Then he returned along the miry road, And spake no word to us, but had the look Of one whom other care constrains and goads Than that of him who in his presence is; And we our feet directed tow'rds the city, After those holy words all confident. Within we entered without any contest; And I, who inclination had to see What the condition such a fortress holds, Soon as I was within, cast round mine eye, 39 \nAnd see on every hand an ample plain, Full of distress and torment terrible. Even as at Arles, where stagnant grows the Rhone, Even as at Pola near to the Quarnaro, That shuts in Italy and bathes its borders, The sepulchres make all the place uneven; So likewise did they there on every side, Saving that there the manner was more bitter; For flames between the sepulchres were scattered, By which they so intensely heated were, That iron more so asks not any art. All of their coverings uplifted were, And from them issued forth such dire laments, Sooth seemed they of the wretched and tormented. And I: \"My Master, what are all those people Who, having sepulture within those tombs, Make themselves audible by doleful sighs?\" And he to me: \"Here are the Heresiarchs, With their disciples of all sects, and much More than thou thinkest laden are the tombs. Here like together with its like is buried; And more and less the monuments are heated.\" And when he to the right had turned, we passed Between the torments and high parapets. 40",
      "modern": "The color that cowardice brought to my face\nwhen I saw my guide turning back\nmade him quickly suppress his own new pallor.\n\nHe stood still and alert, like someone listening,\nbecause the eye could not see far ahead\n\nThe black air could not carry him far through that heavy fog.\n\"We must still win this fight,\" he began,\n\"Otherwise... She who offered herself to us... \nOh, how I long for someone to arrive!\"\n\nI could tell from the moment he began\nthat he was covering up his first words\nwith what came after—\nthey were completely different from what he'd started to say.\nBut his words frightened me nonetheless,\nbecause I completed that broken phrase in my mind,\nperhaps twisting it to something worse than he meant.\n\n\"Does anyone ever descend into this bottom\nof the sorrowful pit from the first circle,\nwhere the only punishment is hope cut away?\"\n\nThis was my question, and he answered:\n\"Rarely

grown cold\nwhen she forced me to enter that wall\nto bring forth a spirit from Judas's circle—\nthe lowest place, the darkest,\nfarthest from the heaven that encircles all.\nI know the way well, so

down.\n\"We should have taken better revenge on Theseus!\"\n\n\"Turn around and keep your eyes shut tight,\"\nmy Master said. \"If the Gorgon appears\nand you see her,\nyou'll never return to the

the veil of these mysterious verses!\n\nNow across the murky waves\ncame the crash of a terrifying sound\nthat made both shores tremble—\nlike a violent wind born of clashing temperatures\nthat strikes the forest without restraint,\nshattering branches, beating them down, sweeping them away.\nIt moves forward proudly, thick with dust,\nputting wild beasts and shepherds to flight.\n\nHe freed my eyes and said: \"Now direct your sight\nalong that ancient foam,\nthere where the smoke is thickest.\"\n\nLike frogs scattering across the water\nbefore their enemy the snake,\neach one huddling down in the mud,\nI saw more than a thousand ruined souls\nfleeing before one who walked on foot\nacross the Styx with dry soles.\n\nHe fanned away that thick air from his face,\noften waving his left hand before him,\nand seemed weary only from this annoyance.\nI could tell he was sent from Heaven,\nand I turned to my Master, who signaled\nthat I should stand quietly and bow.\n\nHow full of scorn he appeared to me!\nHe reached the gate and with a small rod\nopened it—there was no resistance.\n\n\"O outcasts from Heaven, despised people!\"\nhe began on that horrible threshold.\n\"What is this

Their cemetery have upon this side With Epicurus all his followers, Who with the body mortal make the soul; But in the question thou dost put to me, Within here shalt thou soon be satisfied, And likewise in the wish thou keepest silent.\" And I: \"Good Leader, I but keep concealed From thee my heart, that I may speak the less, Nor only now hast thou thereto disposed me.\" \"O Tuscan, thou who through the city of fire Goest alive, thus speaking modestly, Be pleased to stay thy footsteps in this place. Thy mode of speaking makes thee manifest A native of that noble fatherland, To which perhaps I too molestful was.\" Upon a sudden issued forth this sound From out one of the tombs; wherefore I pressed, 41 Fearing, a little nearer to my Leader. And unto me he said: \"Turn thee; what dost thou? Behold there Farinata who has risen; From the waist upwards wholly shalt thou see him.\" I had already fixed mine eyes on his, And he uprose erect with breast and front E'en as if Hell he had in great despite. And with courageous hands and prompt my Leader Thrust me between the sepulchres towards him, Exclaiming, \"Let thy words explicit be.\" As soon as I was at the foot of his tomb Somewhat he eyed me, and, as if disdainful, Then asked of me, \"Who were thine ancestors?\" I, who desirous of obeying was, Concealed it not, but all revealed to him; Whereat he raised his brows a little upward. Then said he: \"Fiercely adverse have they been To me, and to my fathers, and my party; So that two several times I scattered them.\" \"If they were banished, they returned on all sides,\" I answered him, \"the first time and the second; But yours have not acquired that art aright.\" Then there uprose upon the sight, uncovered Down to the chin, a shadow at his side; I think that he had risen on his knees. Round me he gazed, as if solicitude He had to see if some one else were with me, But after his suspicion was all spent, Weeping, he said to me: \"If through this blind Prison thou goest by loftiness of genius, Where is my son? and why is he not with thee?\" And I to him: \"I come not of myself; He who is waiting yonder leads me here, Whom in disdain perhaps your Guido had.\" His language and the mode of punishment Already unto me had read his name; On that account my answer was so full. Up starting suddenly, he cried out: \"How Saidst thou,—he had? Is he not still alive? Does not the sweet light strike upon his eyes?\" 42 \nWhen he became aware of some delay, Which I before my answer made, supine He fell again, and forth appeared no more. But the other, magnanimous, at whose desire I had remained, did not his aspect change, Neither his neck he moved, nor bent his side. \"And if,\" continuing his first discourse, \"They have that art,\" he said, \"not learned aright, That more tormenteth me, than doth this bed. But fifty times shall not rekindled be The countenance of the Lady who reigns here, Ere thou shalt know how heavy is that art; And as thou wouldst to the sweet world return, Say why that people is so pitiless Against my race in each one of its laws?\" Whence I to him: \"The slaughter and great carnage Which have with crimson stained the Arbia, cause Such orisons in our temple to be made.\" After his head he with a sigh had shaken, \"There I was not alone,\" he said, \"nor surely Without a cause had with the others moved. But there I was alone, where every one Consented to the laying waste of Florence, He who defended her with open face.\" \"Ah! so hereafter may your seed repose,\" I him entreated, \"solve for me that knot, Which has entangled my conceptions here. It seems that you can see, if I hear rightly, Beforehand whatsoe'er time brings with it, And in the present have another mode.\" \"We see, like those who have imperfect sight, The things,\" he said, \"that distant are from us; So much still shines on us the Sovereign Ruler. When they draw near, or are, is wholly vain Our intellect, and if none brings it to us, Not anything know we of your human state. Hence thou canst understand, that wholly dead Will be our knowledge from the moment when The portal of the future shall be closed.\" Then I, as if compunctious for my fault, 43 \nSaid: \"Now, then, you will tell that fallen one, That still his son is with the living joined. And if just now, in answering, I was dumb, Tell him I did it because I was thinking Already of the error you have solved me.\" And now my Master was recalling me, Wherefore more eagerly I prayed the spirit That he would tell me who was with him there. He said: \"With more than a thousand here I lie; Within here is the second Frederick, And the Cardinal, and of the rest I speak not.\" Thereon he hid himself; and I towards The ancient poet turned my steps, reflecting Upon that saying, which seemed hostile to me. He moved along; and afterward thus going, He said to me, \"Why art thou so bewildered?\" And I in his inquiry satisfied him. \"Let memory preserve what thou hast heard Against thyself,\" that Sage commanded me, \"And now attend here;\" and he raised his finger. \"When thou shalt be before the radiance sweet Of her whose beauteous eyes all things behold, From her thou'lt know the journey of thy life.\" Unto the left hand then he turned his feet; We left the wall, and went towards the middle, Along a path that strikes into a valley, Which even up there unpleasant made its stench. 44",

Why isn't he with you?\"\n\nAnd I replied: \"I don't come by my own power.\nHe who waits over there leads me here—\nthe one your Guido perhaps held in scorn.\"\n\nHis words and the nature of his punishment\nhad already told me his name,\nwhich is why my answer was so complete.\n\nSuddenly starting up, he cried: \"What\ndid you say—he held?

      "original": "Upon the margin of a lofty bank Which great rocks broken in a circle made, We came upon a still more cruel throng; And there, by reason of the horrible Excess of stench the deep abyss throws out, We drew ourselves aside behind the cover Of a great tomb, whereon I saw a writing, Which said: \"Pope Anastasius I hold, Whom out of the right way Photinus drew.\" \"Slow it behoveth our descent to be, So that the sense be first a little used To the sad blast, and then we shall not heed it.\" The Master thus; and unto him I said, \"Some compensation find, that the time pass not Idly;\" and he: \"Thou seest I think of that. My son, upon the inside of these rocks,\" Began he then to say, \"are three small circles, From grade to grade, like those which thou art leaving. They all are full of spirits maledict; But that hereafter sight alone suffice thee, Hear how and wherefore they are in constraint. Of every malice that wins hate in Heaven, Injury is the end; and all such end Either by force or fraud afflicteth others. But because fraud is man's peculiar vice, More it displeases God; and so stand lowest The fraudulent, and greater dole assails them. All the first circle of the Violent is; But since force may be used against three persons, 45 In three rounds 'tis divided and constructed. To God, to ourselves, and to our neighbour can we Use force; I say on them and on their things, As thou shalt hear with reason manifest. A death by violence, and painful wounds, Are to our neighbour given; and in his substance Ruin, and arson, and injurious levies; Whence homicides, and he who smites unjustly, Marauders, and freebooters, the first round Tormenteth all in companies diverse. Man may lay violent hands upon himself And his own goods; and therefore in the second Round must perforce without avail repent Whoever of your world deprives himself, Who games, and dissipates his property, And weepeth there, where he should jocund be. Violence can be done the Deity, In heart denying and blaspheming Him, And by disdaining Nature and her bounty. And for this reason doth the smallest round Seal with its signet Sodom and Cahors, And who, disdaining God, speaks from the heart. Fraud, wherewithal is every conscience stung, A man may practise upon him who trusts, And him who doth no confidence imburse. This latter mode, it would appear, dissevers Only the bond of love which Nature makes; Wherefore within the second circle nestle Hypocrisy, flattery, and who deals in magic, Falsification, theft, and simony, Panders, and barrators, and the like filth. By the other mode, forgotten is that love Which Nature makes, and what is after added, From which there is a special faith engendered. Hence in the smallest circle, where the point is Of the Universe, upon which Dis is seated, Whoe'er betrays for ever is consumed.\" And I: \"My Master, clear enough proceeds Thy reasoning, and full well distinguishes This cavern and the people who possess it. 46 \nBut tell me, those within the fat lagoon, Whom the wind drives, and whom the rain doth beat, And who encounter with such bitter tongues, Wherefore are they inside of the red city Not punished, if God has them in his wrath, And if he has not, wherefore in such fashion?\" And unto me he said: \"Why wanders so Thine intellect from that which it is wont? Or, sooth, thy mind where is it elsewhere looking? Hast thou no recollection of those words With which thine Ethics thoroughly discusses The dispositions three, that Heaven abides not,— Incontinence, and Malice, and insane Bestiality? and how Incontinence Less God offendeth, and less blame attracts? If thou regardest this conclusion well, And to thy mind recallest who they are That up outside are undergoing penance, Clearly wilt thou perceive why from these felons They separated are, and why less wroth Justice divine doth smite them with its hammer.\" \"O Sun, that healest all distempered vision, Thou dost content me so, when thou resolvest, That doubting pleases me no less than knowing! Once more a little backward turn thee,\" said I, \"There where thou sayest that usury offends Goodness divine, and disengage the knot.\" \"Philosophy,\" he said, \"to him who heeds it, Noteth, not only in one place alone, After what manner Nature takes her course From Intellect Divine, and from its art; And if thy Physics carefully thou notest, After not many pages shalt thou find, That this your art as far as possible Follows, as the disciple doth the master; So that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild. From these two, if thou bringest to thy mind Genesis at the beginning, it behoves Mankind to gain their life and to advance; And since the usurer takes another way, 47 \nNature herself and in her follower Disdains he, for elsewhere he puts his hope.

Therefore in the second round,\nthose who deprive themselves of your world\nmust repent without hope—\nthose who gamble away and waste their wealth,\nweeping where they should have been joyful.\n\nViolence can be done to the Divine\nby denying and cursing Him in the heart,\nand by scorning Nature and her gifts.\nFor this reason the smallest round\nseals with its mark Sodom and Cahors,\nand all who speak contempt of God from the heart.\n\nFraud, which stings every conscience,\ncan be practiced on those who trust\nand on those who place no confidence in you.\nThis second kind seems only to sever\nthe bond of love that Nature creates,\nso in the second circle nest\nhypocrites, flatterers, sorcerers,\nfalsifiers, thieves, those who sell holy offices,\npimps, grafters, and similar filth.\n\nThe other kind of fraud destroys both\nthe love that Nature makes and the added trust\nfrom which special faith is born.\nSo in the smallest circle, at the very point\nof the Universe where Dis sits enthroned,\nall traitors are consumed forever.\"\n\n\"Master,\" I said, \"your explanation is clear enough\nand well distinguishes this pit\nand the people who inhabit it.\nBut tell me—those in the muddy marsh above,\ndriven by wind, beaten by rain,\nclashing with such harsh words—\nwhy aren't they punished inside the red city\nif God holds them in his wrath?\nAnd if he doesn't, why do they suffer so?\"\n\nHe answered, \"Why does your mind wander so\nfrom its usual sharpness?\nOr where else are your thoughts straying?\nDon't you remember those words\nin your Ethics that thoroughly discuss\nthe three dispositions Heaven cannot abide—\nIncontinence, Malice, and mad Bestiality—\nand how Incontinence offends God less\nand draws less blame?\n\nIf you consider this teaching well\nand recall who those souls are\nundergoing penance up outside,\nyou'll clearly see why they're separated\nfrom these criminals, and why divine Justice\nstrikes them with a gentler hammer.\"\n\n\"O Sun who heals all troubled vision,\nyou satisfy me so when you explain\nthat I love doubting no less than knowing!\nTurn back once more,\" I said,\n\"to where you said that usury offends\ndivine Goodness, and untie that knot.\"\n\n\"Philosophy,\" he said, \"teaches those who heed it—\nnot in one place alone—\nhow Nature takes her course\nfrom Divine Intelligence and its craft.\nAnd if you read your Physics carefully,\nyou'll find after just a few pages\nthat human art follows Nature as closely as possible,\nlike a student following a master,\nso that your art is, as it were, God's grandchild.\n\nFrom these two sources—Nature and Art—\nif you recall Genesis at the beginning,\nhumanity must earn its living and advance.\nBut since the usurer takes another path,\nhe scorns both Nature herself and her follower,\nplacing his hope elsewhere.\n\nBut follow me now, for I want to move on.\nThe Fishes are shimmering on the horizon,\nthe Great Bear lies entirely over the northwest wind,\nand far ahead we must descend the cliff.\"",

      "original": "The place where to descend the bank we came Was alpine, and from what was there, moreover, Of such a kind that every eye would shun it. Such as that ruin is which in the flank Smote, on this side of Trent, the Adige, Either by earthquake or by failing stay, For from the mountain's top, from which it moved, Unto the plain the cliff is shattered so, Some path 'twould give to him who was above; Even such was the descent of that ravine, And on the border of the broken chasm The infamy of Crete was stretched along, Who was conceived in the fictitious cow; And when he us beheld, he bit himself, Even as one whom anger racks within. My Sage towards him shouted: \"Peradventure Thou think'st that here may be the Duke of Athens, Who in the world above brought death to thee? Get thee gone, beast, for this one cometh not Instructed by thy sister, but he comes In order to behold your punishments.\" As is that bull who breaks loose at the moment In which he has received the mortal blow, Who cannot walk, but staggers here and there, The Minotaur beheld I do the like; And he, the wary, cried: \"Run to the passage; While he wroth, 'tis well thou shouldst descend.\" Thus down we took our way o'er that discharge 49 Of stones, which oftentimes did move themselves Beneath my feet, from the unwonted burden. Thoughtful I went; and he said: \"Thou art thinking Perhaps upon this ruin, which is guarded By that brute anger which just now I quenched. Now will I have thee know, the other time I here descended to the nether Hell, This precipice had not yet fallen down. But truly, if I well discern, a little Before His coming who the mighty spoil Bore off from Dis, in the supernal circle, Upon all sides the deep and loathsome valley Trembled so, that I thought the Universe Was thrilled with love, by which there are who think The world ofttimes converted into chaos; And at that moment this primeval crag Both here and elsewhere made such overthrow. But fix thine eyes below; for draweth near The river of blood, within which boiling is Whoe'er by violence doth injure others.\" O blind cupidity, O wrath insane, That spurs us onward so in our short life, And in the eternal then so badly steeps us! I saw an ample moat bent like a bow, As one which all the plain encompasses, Conformable to what my Guide had said. And between this and the embankment's foot Centaurs in file were running, armed with arrows, As in the world they used the chase to follow. Beholding us descend, each one stood still, And from the squadron three detached themselves, With bows and arrows in advance selected; And from afar one cried: \"Unto what torment Come ye, who down the hillside are descending? Tell us from there; if not, I draw the bow.\" My Master said: \"Our answer will we make To Chiron, near you there; in evil hour, That will of thine was evermore so hasty.\" Then touched he me, and said: \"This one is Nessus, Who perished for the lovely Dejanira, 50 \nAnd for himself, himself did vengeance take. And he in the midst, who at his breast is gazing, Is the great Chiron, who brought up Achilles; That other Pholus is, who was so wrathful. Thousands and thousands go about the moat Shooting with shafts whatever soul emerges Out of the blood, more than his crime allots.\" Near we approached unto those monsters fleet; Chiron an arrow took, and with the notch Backward upon his jaws he put his beard. After he had uncovered his great mouth, He said to his companions: \"Are you ware That he behind moveth whate'er he touches? Thus are not wont to do the feet of dead men.\" And my good Guide, who now was at his breast, Where the two natures are together joined, Replied: \"Indeed he lives, and thus alone Me it behoves to show him the dark valley; Necessity, and not delight, impels us. Some one withdrew from singing Halleluja, Who unto me committed this new office; No thief is he, nor I a thievish spirit. But by that virtue through which I am moving My steps along this savage thoroughfare, Give us some one of thine, to be with us, And who may show us where to pass the ford, And who may carry this one on his back; For 'tis no spirit that can walk the air.\" Upon his right breast Chiron wheeled about, And said to Nessus: \"Turn and do thou guide them, And warn aside, if other band may meet you.\" We with our faithful escort onward moved Along the brink of the vermilion boiling, Wherein the boiled were uttering loud laments. People I saw within up to the eyebrows, And the great Centaur said: \"Tyrants are these, Who dealt in bloodshed and in pillaging. Here they lament their pitiless mischiefs; here Is Alexander, and fierce Dionysius Who upon Sicily brought dolorous years. 51 \nThat forehead there which has the hair so black Is Azzolin; and the other who is blond, Obizzo is of Esti, who, in truth, Up in the world was by his stepson slain.\" Then turned I to the Poet; and he said, \"Now he be first to thee, and second I.\" A little farther on the Centaur stopped Above a folk, who far down as the throat Seemed from that boiling stream to issue forth. A shade he showed us on one side alone, Saying: \"He cleft asunder in God's bosom The heart that still upon the Thames is honoured.\" Then people saw I, who from out the river Lifted their heads and also all the chest; And many among these I recognised. Thus ever more and more grew shallower That blood, so that the feet alone it covered; And there across the moat our passage was. \"Even as thou here upon this side beholdest The boiling stream, that aye diminishes,\" The Centaur said, \"I wish thee to believe That on this other more and more declines Its bed, until it reunites itself Where it behoveth tyranny to groan. Justice divine, upon this side, is goading That Attila, who was a scourge on earth, And Pyrrhus, and Sextus; and for ever milks The tears which with the boiling it unseals In Rinier da Corneto and Rinier Pazzo, Who made upon the highways so much war.\" Then back he turned, and passed again the ford. 52",
      "modern": "The place where we came down to descend the bank\nwas like an alpine cliff, and what lay there\nwould make any eye recoil in horror.\n\nThe destruction there was of such a kind\nthat every eye would turn away in horror.\nLike that landslide which struck the Adige's flank\non this side of Trent—whether by earthquake\nor failing foundation—where the mountainside\nshattered from peak to plain in such a way\nit might provide a path for those above,\nso was the descent of that ravine.\n\nAnd there upon the edge of the broken chasm\nlay stretched the infamy of Crete,\nconceived within that counterfeit cow.\nWhen he saw us, he bit himself\nlike one consumed by inner rage.\n\nMy guide shouted toward him: \"Perhaps\nyou think the Duke of Athens stands here,\nwho brought your death in the world above?\nGet away, beast!

      "original": "Not yet had Nessus reached the other side, When we had put ourselves within a wood, That was not marked by any path whatever. Not foliage green, but of a dusky colour, Not branches smooth, but gnarled and intertangled, Not apple-trees were there, but thorns with poison. Such tangled thickets have not, nor so dense, Those savage wild beasts, that in hatred hold 'Twixt Cecina and Corneto the tilled places. There do the hideous Harpies make their nests, Who chased the Trojans from the Strophades, With sad announcement of impending doom; Broad wings have they, and necks and faces human, And feet with claws, and their great bellies fledged; They make laments upon the wondrous trees. And the good Master: \"Ere thou enter farther, Know that thou art within the second round,\" Thus he began to say, \"and shalt be, till Thou comest out upon the horrible sand; Therefore look well around, and thou shalt see Things that will credence give unto my speech.\" I heard on all sides lamentations uttered, And person none beheld I who might make them, Whence, utterly bewildered, I stood still. I think he thought that I perhaps might think So many voices issued through those trunks From people who concealed themselves from us; Therefore the Master said: \"If thou break off 53 Some little spray from any of these trees, The thoughts thou hast will wholly be made vain.\" Then stretched I forth my hand a little forward, And plucked a branchlet off from a great thorn; And the trunk cried, \"Why dost thou mangle me?\" After it had become embrowned with blood, It recommenced its cry: \"Why dost thou rend me? Hast thou no spirit of pity whatsoever? Men once we were, and now are changed to trees; Indeed, thy hand should be more pitiful, Even if the souls of serpents we had been.\" As out of a green brand, that is on fire At one of the ends, and from the other drips And hisses with the wind that is escaping; So from that splinter issued forth together Both words and blood; whereat I let the tip Fall, and stood like a man who is afraid. \"Had he been able sooner to believe,\" My Sage made answer, \"O thou wounded soul, What only in my verses he has seen, Not upon thee had he stretched forth his hand; Whereas the thing incredible has caused me To put him to an act which grieveth me. But tell him who thou wast, so that by way Of some amends thy fame he may refresh Up in the world, to which he can return.\" And the trunk said: \"So thy sweet words allure me, I cannot silent be; and you be vexed not, That I a little to discourse am tempted. I am the one who both keys had in keeping Of Frederick's heart, and turned them to and fro So softly in unlocking and in locking, That from his secrets most men I withheld; Fidelity I bore the glorious office So great, I lost thereby my sleep and pulses. The courtesan who never from the dwelling Of Caesar turned aside her strumpet eyes, Death universal and the vice of courts, Inflamed against me all the other minds, And they, inflamed, did so inflame Augustus, 54 \nThat my glad honours turned to dismal mournings. My spirit, in disdainful exultation, Thinking by dying to escape disdain, Made me unjust against myself, the just. I, by the roots unwonted of this wood, Do swear to you that never broke I faith Unto my lord, who was so worthy of honour; And to the world if one of you return, Let him my memory comfort, which is lying Still prostrate from the blow that envy dealt it.\" Waited awhile, and then: \"Since he is silent,\" The Poet said to me, \"lose not the time, But speak, and question him, if more may please thee.\" Whence I to him: \"Do thou again inquire Concerning what thou thinks't will satisfy me; For I cannot, such pity is in my heart.\" Therefore he recommenced: \"So may the man Do for thee freely what thy speech implores, Spirit incarcerate, again be pleased To tell us in what way the soul is bound Within these knots; and tell us, if thou canst, If any from such members e'er is freed.\" Then blew the trunk amain, and afterward The wind was into such a voice converted: \"With brevity shall be replied to you. When the exasperated soul abandons The body whence it rent itself away, Minos consigns it to the seventh abyss. It falls into the forest, and no part Is chosen for it; but where Fortune hurls it, There like a grain of spelt it germinates. It springs a sapling, and a forest tree; The Harpies, feeding then upon its leaves, Do pain create, and for the pain an outlet. Like others for our spoils shall we return; But not that any one may them revest, For 'tis not just to have what one casts off. Here we shall drag them, and along the dismal Forest our bodies shall suspended be, Each to the thorn of his molested shade.\" 55 \nWe were attentive still unto the trunk, Thinking that more it yet might wish to tell us, When by a tumult we were overtaken, In the same way as he is who perceives The boar and chase approaching to his stand, Who hears the crashing of the beasts and branches; And two behold! upon our left-hand side, Naked and scratched, fleeing so furiously, That of the forest, every fan they broke. He who was in advance: \"Now help, Death, help!\" And the other one, who seemed to lag too much, Was shouting: \"Lano, were not so alert Those legs of thine at joustings of the Toppo!\" And then, perchance because his breath was failing, He grouped himself together with a bush. Behind them was the forest full of black She-mastiffs, ravenous, and swift of foot As greyhounds, who are issuing from the chain. On him who had crouched down they set their teeth, And him they lacerated piece by piece, Thereafter bore away those aching members. Thereat my Escort took me by the hand, And led me to the bush, that all in vain Was weeping from its bloody lacerations. \"O Jacopo,\" it said, \"of Sant' Andrea, What helped it thee of me to make a screen? What blame have I in thy nefarious life?\" When near him had the Master stayed his steps, He said: \"Who wast thou, that through wounds so many Art blowing out with blood thy dolorous speech?\" And he to us: \"O souls, that hither come To look upon the shameful massacre That has so rent away from me my leaves, Gather them up beneath the dismal bush; I of that city was which to the Baptist Changed its first patron, wherefore he for this Forever with his art will make it sad. And were it not that on the pass of Arno Some glimpses of him are remaining still, Those citizens, who afterwards rebuilt it 56 \nUpon the ashes left by Attila, In vain had caused their labour to be done. Of my own house I made myself a gibbet.\" 57",
      "modern": "Nessus had not yet reached the other shore\nwhen we entered a wood unmarked by any path.\nThe leaves were not green but dark and withered,\nthe branches not smooth but gnarled and twisted—\nnot fruit trees but poisonous thorns.\nEven the savage beasts that haunt the wasteland\nbetween Cecina and Corneto\nknow no thickets so dense and tangled.\n\nHere the hideous Harpies make their nests,\nthose creatures who drove the Trojans from the Strophades\nwith prophecies of coming doom.\nThey have broad wings, human necks and faces,\nclawed feet, and feathered bellies.\nThey wail their mournful cries from the strange trees.\n\nMy good master said: \"Before you go further,\nknow that you are in the second ring\nand will remain here until you reach\nthe horrible sand beyond.\nLook carefully around you—\nyou will see things that give proof to my words.\"\n\nI heard lamentations on every side\nbut saw no one who could be making them.\nBewildered, I stood frozen.\n\nI think he thought I might be thinking\nthese voices issued from the trunks,\nfrom people hiding themselves from us.\nSo my master said: \"If you break off\na small branch from any of these trees,\nyour assumptions will prove completely wrong.\"\n\nI reached out my hand\nand plucked a twig from a great thorn.\nThe trunk cried out: \"Why do you tear me apart?\"\n\nDark with blood, it cried again:\n\"Why do you wound me?\nHave you no compassion at all?\nWe were men once, now we are trees.\nYour hand should show more mercy\neven if we had been the souls of serpents.\"\n\nLike a green log burning at one end\nthat drips and hisses with escaping sap,\nso from that broken branch came both words and blood.\nI dropped the twig and stood there terrified.\n\n\"O wounded soul,\" my sage replied,\n\"if he could have believed sooner\nwhat he had seen only in my verses,\nhe would not have raised his hand against you.\nBut the incredible nature of this place\nforced me to urge him to this act, which grieves me.\nTell him who you were, so that he might\nrestore your reputation in the world above,\nto which he is allowed to return.\"\n\nThe trunk said: \"Your sweet words so entice me\nI cannot remain silent.

On our left, two figures\nnaked and scratched, fleeing so wildly\nthey shattered every barrier of the forest.\nThe one in front: \"Come quickly, Death!\"\nThe other, who seemed too slow, shouted:\n\"Lano, your legs were not so nimble\nat the tournament of Toppo!\"\n\nThen, perhaps because his breath was failing,\nhe threw himself into a bush.\n\nBehind them the forest swarmed with black mastiffs,\nravenous and swift as greyhounds\njust released from their chains.\nThey set their teeth in the one who had crouched down\nand tore him apart piece by piece,\nthen carried off those suffering limbs.\n\nMy guide took me by the hand\nand led me to the bush that wept in vain\nthrough its bloody wounds.\n\n\"O Jacopo of Sant'Andrea,\" it said,\n\"what good did it do you to make me your shield?\nWhat blame do I bear for your wicked life?\"\n\nWhen my master stopped beside it, he said:\n\"Who were you, that through so many wounds\nbreathe out your sorrowful words with blood?\"\n\nAnd it said to us: \"O souls who have come\nto witness the shameful destruction\nthat has torn my leaves from me,\ngather them beneath this wretched bush.\nI was from that city which changed\nits first patron to the Baptist,\nfor which he will forever afflict it with his art.\nAnd if some trace of him did not remain\nat the crossing of the Arno,\nthose citizens who rebuilt it\non the ashes Attila left behind\nwould have labored in vain.\nI made a gallows of my own house.\"",

Then came we to the confine, where disparted The second round is from the third, and where A horrible form of Justice is beheld. Clearly to manifest these novel things, I say that we arrived upon a plain, Which from its bed rejecteth every plant; The dolorous forest is a garland to it All round about, as the sad moat to that; There close upon the edge we stayed our feet. The soil was of an arid and thick sand, Not of another fashion made than that Which by the feet of Cato once was pressed. Vengeance of God, O how much oughtest thou By each one to be dreaded, who doth read That which was manifest unto mine eyes! Of naked souls beheld I many herds, Who all were weeping very miserably, And over them seemed set a law diverse. Supine upon the ground some folk were lying; And some were sitting all drawn up together, And others went about continually. Those who were going round were far the more, And those were less who lay down to their torment, But had their tongues more loosed to lamentation. O'er all the sand-waste, with a gradual fall, 58 Were raining down dilated flakes of fire, As of the snow on Alp without a wind. As Alexander, in those torrid parts Of India, beheld upon his host Flames fall unbroken till they reached the ground. Whence he provided with his phalanxes To trample down the soil, because the vapour Better extinguished was while it was single; Thus was descending the eternal heat, Whereby the sand was set on fire, like tinder Beneath the steel, for doubling of the dole. Without repose forever was the dance Of miserable hands, now there, now here, Shaking away from off them the fresh gleeds. \"Master,\" began I, \"thou who overcomest All things except the demons dire, that issued Against us at the entrance of the gate, Who is that mighty one who seems to heed not The fire, and lieth lowering and disdainful, So that the rain seems not to ripen him?\" And he himself, who had become aware That I was questioning my Guide about him, Cried: \"Such as I was living, am I, dead. If Jove should weary out his smith, from whom He seized in anger the sharp thunderbolt, Wherewith upon the last day I was smitten, And if he wearied out by turns the others In Mongibello at the swarthy forge, Vociferating, 'Help, good Vulcan, help!' Even as he did there at the fight of Phlegra, And shot his bolts at me with all his might, He would not have thereby a joyous vengeance.\" Then did my Leader speak with such great force, That I had never heard him speak so loud: \"O Capaneus, in that is not extinguished Thine arrogance, thou punished art the more; Not any torment, saving thine own rage, Would be unto thy fury pain complete.\" Then he turned round to me with better lip, Saying: \"One of the Seven Kings was he 59 \nWho Thebes besieged, and held, and seems to hold God in disdain, and little seems to prize him; But, as I said to him, his own despites Are for his breast the fittest ornaments. Now follow me, and mind thou do not place As yet thy feet upon the burning sand, But always keep them close unto the wood.\" Speaking no word, we came to where there gushes Forth from the wood a little rivulet, Whose redness makes my hair still stand on end. As from the Bulicame springs the brooklet, The sinful women later share among them, So downward through the sand it went its way. The bottom of it, and both sloping banks, Were made of stone, and the margins at the side; Whence I perceived that there the passage was. \"In all the rest which I have shown to thee Since we have entered in within the gate Whose threshold unto no one is denied, Nothing has been discovered by thine eyes So notable as is the present river, Which all the little flames above it quenches.\" These words were of my Leader; whence I prayed him That he would give me largess of the food, For which he had given me largess of desire. \"In the mid-sea there sits a wasted land,\" Said he thereafterward, \"whose name is Crete, Under whose king the world of old was chaste. There is a mountain there, that once was glad With waters and with leaves, which was called Ida; Now 'tis deserted, as a thing worn out. Rhea once chose it for the faithful cradle Of her own son; and to conceal him better, Whene'er he cried, she there had clamours made. A grand old man stands in the mount erect, Who holds his shoulders turned tow'rds Damietta, And looks at Rome as if it were his mirror. His head is fashioned of refined gold, And of pure silver are the arms and breast; Then he is brass as far down as the fork. 60 \nFrom that point downward all is chosen iron, Save that the right foot is of kiln-baked clay, And more he stands on that than on the other. Each part, except the gold, is by a fissure Asunder cleft, that dripping is with tears, Which gathered together perforate that cavern. From rock to rock they fall into this valley; Acheron, Styx, and Phlegethon they form; Then downward go along this narrow sluice Unto that point where is no more descending. They form Cocytus; what that pool may be Thou shalt behold, so here 'tis not narrated.\" And I to him: \"If so the present runnel Doth take its rise in this way from our world, Why only on this verge appears it to us?\" And he to me: \"Thou knowest the place is round, And notwithstanding thou hast journeyed far, Still to the left descending to the bottom, Thou hast not yet through all the circle turned. Therefore if something new appear to us, It should not bring amazement to thy face.\" And I again: \"Master, where shall be found Lethe and Phlegethon, for of one thou'rt silent, And sayest the other of this rain is made?\" \"In all thy questions truly thou dost please me,\" Replied he; \"but the boiling of the red Water might well solve one of them thou makest. Thou shalt see Lethe, but outside this moat, There where the souls repair to lave themselves, When sin repented of has been removed.\" Then said he: \"It is time now to abandon The wood; take heed that thou come after me; A way the margins make that are not burning, And over them all vapours are extinguished.\" 61",

      "original": "Now bears us onward one of the hard margins, And so the brooklet's mist o'ershadows it, From fire it saves the water and the dikes. Even as the Flemings, 'twixt Cadsand and Bruges, Fearing the flood that tow'rds them hurls itself, Their bulwarks build to put the sea to flight; And as the Paduans along the Brenta, To guard their villas and their villages, Or ever Chiarentana feel the heat; In such similitude had those been made, Albeit not so lofty nor so thick, Whoever he might be, the master made them. Now were we from the forest so remote, I could not have discovered where it was, Even if backward I had turned myself, When we a company of souls encountered, Who came beside the dike, and every one Gazed at us, as at evening we are wont To eye each other under a new moon, And so towards us sharpened they their brows As an old tailor at the needle's eye. Thus scrutinised by such a family, By some one I was recognised, who seized My garment's hem, and cried out, \"What a marvel!\" And I, when he stretched forth his arm to me, On his baked aspect fastened so mine eyes, That the scorched countenance prevented not His recognition by my intellect; And bowing down my face unto his own, I made reply, \"Are you here, Ser Brunetto?\" 62 And he: \"May't not displease thee, O my son, If a brief space with thee Brunetto Latini Backward return and let the trail go on.\" I said to him: \"With all my power I ask it; And if you wish me to sit down with you, I will, if he please, for I go with him.\" \"O son,\" he said, \"whoever of this herd A moment stops, lies then a hundred years, Nor fans himself when smiteth him the fire. Therefore go on; I at thy skirts will come, And afterward will I rejoin my band, Which goes lamenting its eternal doom.\" I did not dare to go down from the road Level to walk with him; but my head bowed I held as one who goeth reverently. And he began: \"What fortune or what fate Before the last day leadeth thee down here? And who is this that showeth thee the way?\" \"Up there above us in the life serene,\" I answered him, \"I lost me in a valley, Or ever yet my age had been completed. But yestermorn I turned my back upon it; This one appeared to me, returning thither, And homeward leadeth me along this road.\" And he to me: \"If thou thy star do follow, Thou canst not fail thee of a glorious port, If well I judged in the life beautiful. And if I had not died so prematurely, Seeing Heaven thus benignant unto thee, I would have given thee comfort in the work. But that ungrateful and malignant people, Which of old time from Fesole descended, And smacks still of the mountain and the granite, Will make itself, for thy good deeds, thy foe; And it is right; for among crabbed sorbs It ill befits the sweet fig to bear fruit. Old rumour in the world proclaims them blind; A people avaricious, envious, proud; Take heed that of their customs thou do cleanse thee. Thy fortune so much honour doth reserve thee, 63 \nOne party and the other shall be hungry For thee; but far from goat shall be the grass. Their litter let the beasts of Fesole Make of themselves, nor let them touch the plant, If any still upon their dunghill rise, In which may yet revive the consecrated Seed of those Romans, who remained there when The nest of such great malice it became.\" \"If my entreaty wholly were fulfilled,\" Replied I to him, \"not yet would you be In banishment from human nature placed; For in my mind is fixed, and touches now My heart the dear and good paternal image Of you, when in the world from hour to hour You taught me how a man becomes eternal; And how much I am grateful, while I live Behoves that in my language be discerned. What you narrate of my career I write, And keep it to be glossed with other text By a Lady who can do it, if I reach her. This much will I have manifest to you; Provided that my conscience do not chide me, For whatsoever Fortune I am ready. Such handsel is not new unto mine ears; Therefore let Fortune turn her wheel around As it may please her, and the churl his mattock.\" My Master thereupon on his right cheek Did backward turn himself, and looked at me; Then said: \"He listeneth well who noteth it.\" Nor speaking less on that account, I go With Ser Brunetto, and I ask who are His most known and most eminent companions. And he to me: \"To know of some is well; Of others it were laudable to be silent, For short would be the time for so much speech. Know them in sum, that all of them were clerks, And men of letters great and of great fame, In the world tainted with the selfsame sin. Priscian goes yonder with that wretched crowd, And Francis of Accorso; and thou hadst seen there 64 \nIf thou hadst had a hankering for such scurf, That one, who by the Servant of the Servants From Arno was transferred to Bacchiglione, Where he has left his sin-excited nerves. More would I say, but coming and discoursing Can be no longer; for that I behold New smoke uprising yonder from the sand.

Towards us came they, and each one cried out: \"Stop, thou; for by thy garb to us thou seemest To be some one of our depraved city.\" Ah me! what wounds I saw upon their limbs, Recent and ancient by the flames burnt in! It pains me still but to remember it. Unto their cries my Teacher paused attentive; He turned his face towards me, and \"Now wait,\" He said; \"to these we should be courteous. And if it were not for the fire that darts The nature of this region, I should say That haste were more becoming thee than them.\" As soon as we stood still, they recommenced The old refrain, and when they overtook us, Formed of themselves a wheel, all three of them. As champions stripped and oiled are wont to do, Watching for their advantage and their hold, Before they come to blows and thrusts between them, Thus, wheeling round, did every one his visage Direct to me, so that in opposite wise His neck and feet continual journey made. And, \"If the misery of this soft place Bring in disdain ourselves and our entreaties,\" 66 Began one, \"and our aspect black and blistered, Let the renown of us thy mind incline To tell us who thou art, who thus securely Thy living feet dost move along through Hell. He in whose footprints thou dost see me treading, Naked and skinless though he now may go, Was of a greater rank than thou dost think; He was the grandson of the good Gualdrada; His name was Guidoguerra, and in life Much did he with his wisdom and his sword. The other, who close by me treads the sand, Tegghiaio Aldobrandi is, whose fame Above there in the world should welcome be. And I, who with them on the cross am placed, Jacopo Rusticucci was; and truly My savage wife, more than aught else, doth harm me.\" Could I have been protected from the fire, Below I should have thrown myself among them, And think the Teacher would have suffered it; But as I should have burned and baked myself, My terror overmastered my good will, Which made me greedy of embracing them. Then I began: \"Sorrow and not disdain Did your condition fix within me so, That tardily it wholly is stripped off, As soon as this my Lord said unto me Words, on account of which I thought within me That people such as you are were approaching. I of your city am; and evermore Your labours and your honourable names I with affection have retraced and heard. I leave the gall, and go for the sweet fruits Promised to me by the veracious Leader; But to the centre first I needs must plunge.\" \"So may the soul for a long while conduct Those limbs of thine,\" did he make answer then, \"And so may thy renown shine after thee, Valour and courtesy, say if they dwell Within our city, as they used to do, Or if they wholly have gone out of it; 67 \nFor Guglielmo Borsier, who is in torment With us of late, and goes there with his comrades, Doth greatly mortify us with his words.\" \"The new inhabitants and the sudden gains, Pride and extravagance have in thee engendered, Florence, so that thou weep'st thereat already!\" In this wise I exclaimed with face uplifted; And the three, taking that for my reply, Looked at each other, as one looks at truth. \"If other times so little it doth cost thee,\" Replied they all, \"to satisfy another, Happy art thou, thus speaking at thy will! Therefore, if thou escape from these dark places, And come to rebehold the beauteous stars, When it shall pleasure thee to say, 'I was,' See that thou speak of us unto the people.\" Then they broke up the wheel, and in their flight It seemed as if their agile legs were wings. Not an Amen could possibly be said So rapidly as they had disappeared; Wherefore the Master deemed best to depart. I followed him, and little had we gone, Before the sound of water was so near us, That speaking we should hardly have been heard. Even as that stream which holdeth its own course The first from Monte Veso tow'rds the East, Upon the left-hand slope of Apennine, Which is above called Acquacheta, ere It down descendeth into its low bed, And at Forli is vacant of that name, Reverberates there above San Benedetto From Alps, by falling at a single leap, Where for a thousand there were room enough; Thus downward from a bank precipitate, We found resounding that dark-tinted water, So that it soon the ear would have offended. I had a cord around about me girt, And therewithal I whilom had designed To take the panther with the painted skin. After I this had all from me unloosed, 68 \nAs my Conductor had commanded me, I reached it to him, gathered up and coiled, Whereat he turned himself to the right side, And at a little distance from the verge, He cast it down into that deep abyss. \"It must needs be some novelty respond,\" I said within myself, \"to the new signal The Master with his eye is following so.\" Ah me! how very cautious men should be With those who not alone behold the act, But with their wisdom look into the thoughts! He said to me: \"Soon there will upward come What I await; and what thy thought is dreaming Must soon reveal itself unto thy sight.\" Aye to that truth which has the face of falsehood, A man should close his lips as far as may be, Because without his fault it causes shame; But here I cannot; and, Reader, by the notes Of this my Comedy to thee I swear, So may they not be void of lasting favour, Athwart that dense and darksome atmosphere I saw a figure swimming upward come, Marvellous unto every steadfast heart, Even as he returns who goeth down Sometimes to clear an anchor, which has grappled Reef, or aught else that in the sea is hidden, Who upward stretches, and draws in his feet. 69",

reports.\"\n\n\"New money and sudden wealth\nhave bred such pride and excess in you, Florence,\nthat you're already weeping for it!\"\nI cried out with upturned face.\n\nThe three souls, taking this as my answer,\nlooked at each other as people do\nwhen they recognize truth.\n\n\"If it costs you so little effort other times\nto satisfy someone's question,\" they all replied,\n\"how fortunate you are to speak so freely!\nTherefore, if you escape from these dark places\nand return to see the beautiful stars,\nwhen it pleases you to say 'I was there,'\nbe sure to speak of us to the living.\"\n\nThen they broke their wheel formation,\nand in their flight it seemed\ntheir swift legs had become wings.\nAn \"Amen\" could not have been spoken\nas quickly as they disappeared,\nand my Master thought it best to continue.\n\nI followed him, and we had gone only a little way\nwhen the sound of water grew so loud\nthat we could hardly have heard each other speak.\n\nLike that river

thoughts with their wisdom!\n\nHe said to me: \"What I'm waiting for\nwill soon rise up, and what your mind\nis puzzling over will reveal itself to your sight.\"\n\nA person should always seal his

      "original": "\"Behold the monster with the pointed tail, Who cleaves the hills, and breaketh walls and weapons, Behold him who infecteth all the world.\" Thus unto me my Guide began to say, And beckoned him that he should come to shore, Near to the confine of the trodden marble; And that uncleanly image of deceit Came up and thrust ashore its head and bust, But on the border did not drag its tail. The face was as the face of a just man, Its semblance outwardly was so benign, And of a serpent all the trunk beside. Two paws it had, hairy unto the armpits; The back, and breast, and both the sides it had Depicted o'er with nooses and with shields. With colours more, groundwork or broidery Never in cloth did Tartars make nor Turks, Nor were such tissues by Arachne laid. As sometimes wherries lie upon the shore, That part are in the water, part on land; And as among the guzzling Germans there, The beaver plants himself to wage his war; So that vile monster lay upon the border, Which is of stone, and shutteth in the sand. His tail was wholly quivering in the void, Contorting upwards the envenomed fork, That in the guise of scorpion armed its point. The Guide said: \"Now perforce must turn aside Our way a little, even to that beast 70 Malevolent, that yonder coucheth him.\" We therefore on the right side descended, And made ten steps upon the outer verge, Completely to avoid the sand and flame; And after we are come to him, I see A little farther off upon the sand A people sitting near the hollow place. Then said to me the Master: \"So that full Experience of this round thou bear away, Now go and see what their condition is. There let thy conversation be concise; Till thou returnest I will speak with him, That he concede to us his stalwart shoulders.\" Thus farther still upon the outermost Head of that seventh circle all alone I went, where sat the melancholy folk. Out of their eyes was gushing forth their woe; This way, that way, they helped them with their hands Now from the flames and now from the hot soil. Not otherwise in summer do the dogs, Now with the foot, now with the muzzle, when By fleas, or flies, or gadflies, they are bitten. When I had turned mine eyes upon the faces Of some, on whom the dolorous fire is falling, Not one of them I knew; but I perceived That from the neck of each there hung a pouch, Which certain colour had, and certain blazon; And thereupon it seems their eyes are feeding. And as I gazing round me come among them, Upon a yellow pouch I azure saw That had the face and posture of a lion. Proceeding then the current of my sight, Another of them saw I, red as blood, Display a goose more white than butter is. And one, who with an azure sow and gravid Emblazoned had his little pouch of white, Said unto me: \"What dost thou in this moat? Now get thee gone; and since thou'rt still alive, Know that a neighbour of mine, Vitaliano, Will have his seat here on my left-hand side. 71 \nA Paduan am I with these Florentines; Full many a time they thunder in mine ears, Exclaiming, 'Come the sovereign cavalier, He who shall bring the satchel with three goats;'\" Then twisted he his mouth, and forth he thrust His tongue, like to an ox that licks its nose. And fearing lest my longer stay might vex Him who had warned me not to tarry long, Backward I turned me from those weary souls. I found my Guide, who had already mounted Upon the back of that wild animal, And said to me: \"Now be both strong and bold. Now we descend by stairways such as these; Mount thou in front, for I will be midway, So that the tail may have no power to harm thee.\" Such as he is who has so near the ague Of quartan that his nails are blue already, And trembles all, but looking at the shade; Even such became I at those proffered words; But shame in me his menaces produced, Which maketh servant strong before good master. I seated me upon those monstrous shoulders; I wished to say, and yet the voice came not As I believed, \"Take heed that thou embrace me.\" But he, who other times had rescued me In other peril, soon as I had mounted, Within his arms encircled and sustained me, And said: \"Now, Geryon, bestir thyself; The circles large, and the descent be little; Think of the novel burden which thou hast.\" Even as the little vessel shoves from shore, Backward, still backward, so he thence withdrew; And when he wholly felt himself afloat, There where his breast had been he turned his tail, And that extended like an eel he moved, And with his paws drew to himself the air. A greater fear I do not think there was What time abandoned Phaeton the reins, Whereby the heavens, as still appears, were scorched; Nor when the wretched Icarus his flanks 72 \nFelt stripped of feathers by the melting wax, His father crying, \"An ill way thou takest!\" Than was my own, when I perceived myself On all sides in the air, and saw extinguished The sight of everything but of the monster. Onward he goeth, swimming slowly, slowly; Wheels and descends, but I perceive it only By wind upon my face and from below. I heard already on the right the whirlpool Making a horrible crashing under us; Whence I thrust out my head with eyes cast downward. Then was I still more fearful of the abyss; Because I fires beheld, and heard laments, Whereat I, trembling, all the closer cling. I saw then, for before I had not seen it, The turning and descending, by great horrors That were approaching upon divers sides. As falcon who has long been on the wing, Who, without seeing either lure or bird, Maketh the falconer say, \"Ah me, thou stoopest,\" Descendeth weary, whence he started swiftly, Thorough a hundred circles, and alights Far from his master, sullen and disdainful; Even thus did Geryon place us on the bottom, Close to the bases of the rough-hewn rock, And being disencumbered of our persons, He sped away as arrow from the string. 73",

      "original": "There is a place in Hell called Malebolge, Wholly of stone and of an iron colour, As is the circle that around it turns. Right in the middle of the field malign There yawns a well exceeding wide and deep, Of which its place the structure will recount. Round, then, is that enclosure which remains Between the well and foot of the high, hard bank, And has distinct in valleys ten its bottom. As where for the protection of the walls Many and many moats surround the castles, The part in which they are a figure forms, Just such an image those presented there; And as about such strongholds from their gates Unto the outer bank are little bridges, So from the precipice's base did crags Project, which intersected dikes and moats, Unto the well that truncates and collects them. Within this place, down shaken from the back Of Geryon, we found us; and the Poet Held to the left, and I moved on behind. Upon my right hand I beheld new anguish, New torments, and new wielders of the lash, Wherewith the foremost Bolgia was replete. Down at the bottom were the sinners naked; This side the middle came they facing us, Beyond it, with us, but with greater steps; 74 Even as the Romans, for the mighty host, The year of Jubilee, upon the bridge, Have chosen a mode to pass the people over; For all upon one side towards the Castle Their faces have, and go unto St. Peter's; On the other side they go towards the Mountain. This side and that, along the livid stone Beheld I horned demons with great scourges, Who cruelly were beating them behind. Ah me! how they did make them lift their legs At the first blows! and sooth not any one The second waited for, nor for the third. While I was going on, mine eyes by one Encountered were; and straight I said: \"Already With sight of this one I am not unfed.\" Therefore I stayed my feet to make him out, And with me the sweet Guide came to a stand, And to my going somewhat back assented; And he, the scourged one, thought to hide himself, Lowering his face, but little it availed him; For said I: \"Thou that castest down thine eyes, If false are not the features which thou bearest, Thou art Venedico Caccianimico; But what doth bring thee to such pungent sauces?\" And he to me: \"Unwillingly I tell it; But forces me thine utterance distinct, Which makes me recollect the ancient world. I was the one who the fair Ghisola Induced to grant the wishes of the Marquis, Howe'er the shameless story may be told. Not the sole Bolognese am I who weeps here; Nay, rather is this place so full of them, That not so many tongues to-day are taught 'Twixt Reno and Savena to say 'sipa;' And if thereof thou wishest pledge or proof, Bring to thy mind our avaricious heart.\" While speaking in this manner, with his scourge A demon smote him, and said: \"Get thee gone Pander, there are no women here for coin.\" I joined myself again unto mine Escort; 75 \nThereafterward with footsteps few we came To where a crag projected from the bank. This very easily did we ascend, And turning to the right along its ridge, From those eternal circles we departed. When we were there, where it is hollowed out Beneath, to give a passage to the scourged, The Guide said: \"Wait, and see that on thee strike The vision of those others evil-born, Of whom thou hast not yet beheld the faces, Because together with us they have gone.\" From the old bridge we looked upon the train Which tow'rds us came upon the other border, And which the scourges in like manner smite. And the good Master, without my inquiring, Said to me: \"See that tall one who is coming, And for his pain seems not to shed a tear; Still what a royal aspect he retains! That Jason is, who by his heart and cunning The Colchians of the Ram made destitute. He by the isle of Lemnos passed along After the daring women pitiless Had unto death devoted all their males. There with his tokens and with ornate words Did he deceive Hypsipyle, the maiden Who first, herself, had all the rest deceived. There did he leave her pregnant and forlorn; Such sin unto such punishment condemns him, And also for Medea is vengeance done. With him go those who in such wise deceive; And this sufficient be of the first valley To know, and those that in its jaws it holds.\" We were already where the narrow path Crosses athwart the second dike, and forms Of that a buttress for another arch. Thence we heard people, who are making moan In the next Bolgia, snorting with their muzzles, And with their palms beating upon themselves The margins were incrusted with a mould By exhalation from below, that sticks there, 76 \nAnd with the eyes and nostrils wages war. The bottom is so deep, no place suffices To give us sight of it, without ascending The arch's back, where most the crag impends. Thither we came, and thence down in the moat I saw a people smothered in a filth That out of human privies seemed to flow; And whilst below there with mine eye I search, I saw one with his head so foul with ordure, It was not clear if he were clerk or layman. He screamed to me: \"Wherefore art thou so eager To look at me more than the other foul ones?\" And I to him: \"Because, if I remember, I have already seen thee with dry hair, And thou'rt Alessio Interminei of Lucca; Therefore I eye thee more than all the others.\" And he thereon, belabouring his pumpkin: \"The flatteries have submerged me here below, Wherewith my tongue was never surfeited.\" Then said to me the Guide: \"See that thou thrust Thy visage somewhat farther in advance, That with thine eyes thou well the face attain Of that uncleanly and dishevelled drab, Who there doth scratch herself with filthy nails, And crouches now, and now on foot is standing. Thais the harlot is it, who replied Unto her paramour, when he said, 'Have I Great gratitude from thee?'—'Nay, marvellous;' And herewith let our sight be satisfied.\" 77",

      "original": "O Simon Magus, O forlorn disciples, Ye who the things of God, which ought to be The brides of holiness, rapaciously For silver and for gold do prostitute, Now it behoves for you the trumpet sound, Because in this third Bolgia ye abide. We had already on the following tomb Ascended to that portion of the crag Which o'er the middle of the moat hangs plumb. Wisdom supreme, O how great art thou showest In heaven, in earth, and in the evil world, And with what justice doth thy power distribute! I saw upon the sides and on the bottom The livid stone with perforations filled, All of one size, and every one was round. To me less ample seemed they not, nor greater Than those that in my beautiful Saint John Are fashioned for the place of the baptisers, And one of which, not many years ago, I broke for some one, who was drowning in it; Be this a seal all men to undeceive. Out of the mouth of each one there protruded The feet of a transgressor, and the legs Up to the calf, the rest within remained. In all of them the soles were both on fire; Wherefore the joints so violently quivered, They would have snapped asunder withes and bands. Even as the flame of unctuous things is wont To move upon the outer surface only, 78 So likewise was it there from heel to point. \"Master, who is that one who writhes himself, More than his other comrades quivering,\" I said, \"and whom a redder flame is sucking?\" And he to me: \"If thou wilt have me bear thee Down there along that bank which lowest lies, From him thou'lt know his errors and himself.\" And I: \"What pleases thee, to me is pleasing; Thou art my Lord, and knowest that I depart not From thy desire, and knowest what is not spoken.\" Straightway upon the fourth dike we arrived; We turned, and on the left-hand side descended Down to the bottom full of holes and narrow. And the good Master yet from off his haunch Deposed me not, till to the hole he brought me Of him who so lamented with his shanks. \"Whoe'er thou art, that standest upside down, O doleful soul, implanted like a stake,\" To say began I, \"if thou canst, speak out.\" I stood even as the friar who is confessing The false assassin, who, when he is fixed, Recalls him, so that death may be delayed. And he cried out: \"Dost thou stand there already, Dost thou stand there already, Boniface? By many years the record lied to me. Art thou so early satiate with that wealth, For which thou didst not fear to take by fraud The beautiful Lady, and then work her woe?\" Such I became, as people are who stand, Not comprehending what is answered them, As if bemocked, and know not how to answer. Then said Virgilius: \"Say to him straightway, 'I am not he, I am not he thou thinkest.'\" And I replied as was imposed on me. Whereat the spirit writhed with both his feet, Then, sighing, with a voice of lamentation Said to me: \"Then what wantest thou of me? If who I am thou carest so much to know, That thou on that account hast crossed the bank, Know that I vested was with the great mantle; 79 \nAnd truly was I son of the She-bear, So eager to advance the cubs, that wealth Above, and here myself, I pocketed. Beneath my head the others are dragged down Who have preceded me in simony, Flattened along the fissure of the rock. Below there I shall likewise fall, whenever That one shall come who I believed thou wast, What time the sudden question I proposed. But longer I my feet already toast, And here have been in this way upside down, Than he will planted stay with reddened feet; For after him shall come of fouler deed From tow'rds the west a Pastor without law, Such as befits to cover him and me. New Jason will he be, of whom we read In Maccabees; and as his king was pliant, So he who governs France shall be to this one.\" I do not know if I were here too bold, That him I answered only in this metre: \"I pray thee tell me now how great a treasure Our Lord demanded of Saint Peter first, Before he put the keys into his keeping? Truly he nothing asked but 'Follow me.' Nor Peter nor the rest asked of Matthias Silver or gold, when he by lot was chosen Unto the place the guilty soul had lost. Therefore stay here, for thou art justly punished, And keep safe guard o'er the ill-gotten money, Which caused thee to be valiant against Charles. And were it not that still forbids it me The reverence for the keys superlative Thou hadst in keeping in the gladsome life, I would make use of words more grievous still; Because your avarice afflicts the world, Trampling the good and lifting the depraved. The Evangelist you Pastors had in mind, When she who sitteth upon many waters To fornicate with kings by him was seen; The same who with the seven heads was born, 80 \nAnd power and strength from the ten horns received, So long as virtue to her spouse was pleasing. Ye have made yourselves a god of gold and silver; And from the idolater how differ ye, Save that he one, and ye a hundred worship? Ah, Constantine! of how much ill was mother, Not thy conversion, but that marriage dower Which the first wealthy Father took from thee!\" And while I sang to him such notes as these, Either that anger or that conscience stung him, He struggled violently with both his feet. I think in sooth that it my Leader pleased, With such contented lip he listened ever Unto the sound of the true words expressed. Therefore with both his arms he took me up, And when he had me all upon his breast, Remounted by the way where he descended. Nor did he tire to have me clasped to him; But bore me to the summit of the arch Which from the fourth dike to the fifth is passage.

O you wretched followers,\nyou who take the things of God—which should be\nwedded to righteousness—and prostitute them,\nselling them greedily for silver and gold.\nNow the trumpet must sound for you,\nbecause you dwell in this third ditch.\n\nWe had already climbed onto the next tomb,\nto that portion of the ridge which hangs\ndirectly over the center of the moat.\nO supreme Wisdom, how great is the art you display\nin heaven, on earth, and in this world of evil,\nand how justly your power distributes punishment!\n\nI saw the dark stone, both on the sides\nand on the bottom, filled with round holes,\nall the same size, each one perfectly circular.\nThey seemed no smaller and no larger\nthan those in my beautiful San Giovanni\nthat are made for the baptizers to stand in—\none of which, not many years ago,\nI broke to save someone who was drowning;\nlet this be my seal to set all minds at rest.\n\nFrom the mouth of each hole protruded\nthe feet of a sinner, and the legs\nup to the calves; the rest remained inside.\nThe soles of all their feet were aflame,\nmaking their joints quiver so violently\nthey would have snapped ropes and chains.\n\nJust as flame on oily things\nmoves only along the outer surface,\nso it was there from heel to toe.\n\n\"Master,\" I said, \"who is that one writhing more\nthan all his other companions,\nthe one a redder flame is devouring?\"\n\nAnd he replied: \"If you want me to carry you\ndown there along that lower bank,\nyou'll learn from him about his sins and himself.\"\n\nAnd I: \"Whatever pleases you pleases me.\nYou are my lord, and you know I never stray\nfrom your will, and you know what I leave unspoken.\"\n\nWe came at once to the fourth embankment.\nWe turned and descended on the left side\ndown to the bottom, narrow and full of holes.\nThe good Master did not set me down\nfrom his side until he brought me\nto the hole of the one lamenting with his legs.\n\n\"Whoever you are, wretched soul,\nplanted upside down like a stake,\"\nI began to say, \"speak if you can.\"\n\nI stood like a friar hearing confession\nfrom a treacherous assassin who, once fixed in place,\ncalls him back to delay his death.\n\nAnd he cried out: \"Are you standing there already?\nAre you standing there already, Boniface?\nThe prophecy has lied to me by several years!\nAre you so quickly sated with that wealth\nfor which you did not fear to take by fraud\nthe beautiful Lady, and then destroy her?\"\n\nI became like people who stand there\nnot understanding what is said to them,\nas if mocked, not knowing how to answer.\n\nThen Virgil said: \"Tell him quickly:\n'I am not he, I am not the one you think.'\"\nAnd I answered as he instructed me.\n\nAt this the spirit twisted both his feet,\nthen sighing, with a voice of lamentation,\nsaid to me: \"Then what do you want from me?\nIf you care so much to know who I am\nthat you have crossed the bank for that reason,\nknow that I was clothed with the great mantle,\nand truly I was a son of the She-bear,\nso eager to advance my cubs that I pocketed\nwealth above, and here pocket myself.\n\nBeneath my head are dragged down all the others\nwho preceded me in simony,\nflattened along the fissure of the rock.\nI too will fall down there when he comes—\nthe one I thought you were\nwhen I asked that sudden question.\n\nBut I have already been roasting my feet\nand staying here upside down\nlonger than he will remain planted with red feet.\nFor after him will come a pastor without law,\nfrom the west, of fouler deeds,\nfit to cover both him and me.\n\nHe will be a new Jason, like the one\nwe read about in Maccabees;\nand as that king was soft toward Jason,\nso the one who rules France will be toward this one.\"\n\nI don't know if I was too bold here,\nbut I answered him in this way:\n\"Now tell me: how much treasure\ndid our Lord ask of Saint Peter\nbefore he put the keys in his keeping?\nSurely he asked nothing but 'Follow me.'\nNeither Peter nor the others asked\nsilver or gold from Matthias\nwhen he was chosen by lot\nfor the place the guilty soul had lost.\n\nTherefore stay here, for you are justly punished,\nand guard well the ill-gotten money\nthat made you bold against Charles.\nAnd if it were not that reverence\nfor the supreme keys you held\nin the joyful life still restrains me,\nI would use even harsher words.\nFor your greed afflicts the world,\ntrampling the good and lifting up the wicked.\n\nYou pastors the Evangelist had in mind\nwhen he saw her who sits upon many waters\ncommitting fornication with kings—\nshe who was born with seven heads\nand drew power and strength from ten horns,\nas long as virtue pleased her husband.\n\nYou have made yourselves a god of gold and silver.\nHow do you differ from the idolater,\nexcept that he worships one, and you a hundred?\n\nAh Constantine! How much evil came\nnot from your conversion, but from that dowry\nwhich the first rich Pope received from you!\"\n\nAnd while I sang these notes to him,\nwhether anger or conscience bit him,\nhe kicked violently with both feet.\n\nI think it truly pleased my guide,\nfor with such satisfied expression\nhe kept listening to the sound of those true words.\n\nThen he took me up in both his arms,\nand when he had me completely on his chest,\nhe climbed back up the way he had descended.\nNor did he tire of holding me close,\nbut carried me to the summit of the arch\nthat crosses from the fourth ditch to the fifth.\n\nThere he set down his burden tenderly,\ntenderly on the rough and steep crag\nthat would be hard passage even for goats.\nFrom there another valley was revealed to me.",

      "original": "Of a new pain behoves me to make verses And give material to the twentieth canto Of the first song, which is of the submerged. I was already thoroughly disposed To peer down into the uncovered depth, Which bathed itself with tears of agony; And people saw I through the circular valley, Silent and weeping, coming at the pace Which in this world the Litanies assume. As lower down my sight descended on them, Wondrously each one seemed to be distorted From chin to the beginning of the chest; For tow'rds the reins the countenance was turned, And backward it behoved them to advance, As to look forward had been taken from them. Perchance indeed by violence of palsy Some one has been thus wholly turned awry; But I ne'er saw it, nor believe it can be. As God may let thee, Reader, gather fruit From this thy reading, think now for thyself How I could ever keep my face unmoistened, When our own image near me I beheld Distorted so, the weeping of the eyes Along the fissure bathed the hinder parts. Truly I wept, leaning upon a peak Of the hard crag, so that my Escort said To me: \"Art thou, too, of the other fools? 82 Here pity lives when it is wholly dead; Who is a greater reprobate than he Who feels compassion at the doom divine? Lift up, lift up thy head, and see for whom Opened the earth before the Thebans' eyes; Wherefore they all cried: 'Whither rushest thou, Amphiaraus? Why dost leave the war?' And downward ceased he not to fall amain As far as Minos, who lays hold on all. See, he has made a bosom of his shoulders! Because he wished to see too far before him Behind he looks, and backward goes his way: Behold Tiresias, who his semblance changed, When from a male a female he became, His members being all of them transformed; And afterwards was forced to strike once more The two entangled serpents with his rod, Ere he could have again his manly plumes. That Aruns is, who backs the other's belly, Who in the hills of Luni, there where grubs The Carrarese who houses underneath, Among the marbles white a cavern had For his abode; whence to behold the stars And sea, the view was not cut off from him. And she there, who is covering up her breasts, Which thou beholdest not, with loosened tresses, And on that side has all the hairy skin, Was Manto, who made quest through many lands, Afterwards tarried there where I was born; Whereof I would thou list to me a little. After her father had from life departed, And the city of Bacchus had become enslaved, She a long season wandered through the world. Above in beauteous Italy lies a lake At the Alp's foot that shuts in Germany Over Tyrol, and has the name Benaco. By a thousand springs, I think, and more, is bathed, 'Twixt Garda and Val Camonica, Pennino, With water that grows stagnant in that lake. Midway a place is where the Trentine Pastor, 83 \nAnd he of Brescia, and the Veronese Might give his blessing, if he passed that way. Sitteth Peschiera, fortress fair and strong, To front the Brescians and the Bergamasks, Where round about the bank descendeth lowest. There of necessity must fall whatever In bosom of Benaco cannot stay, And grows a river down through verdant pastures. Soon as the water doth begin to run, No more Benaco is it called, but Mincio, Far as Governo, where it falls in Po. Not far it runs before it finds a plain In which it spreads itself, and makes it marshy, And oft 'tis wont in summer to be sickly. Passing that way the virgin pitiless Land in the middle of the fen descried, Untilled and naked of inhabitants; There to escape all human intercourse, She with her servants stayed, her arts to practise And lived, and left her empty body there. The men, thereafter, who were scattered round, Collected in that place, which was made strong By the lagoon it had on every side; They built their city over those dead bones, And, after her who first the place selected, Mantua named it, without other omen. Its people once within more crowded were, Ere the stupidity of Casalodi From Pinamonte had received deceit. Therefore I caution thee, if e'er thou hearest Originate my city otherwise, No falsehood may the verity defraud.\" And I: \"My Master, thy discourses are To me so certain, and so take my faith, That unto me the rest would be spent coals. But tell me of the people who are passing, If any one note-worthy thou beholdest, For only unto that my mind reverts.\" Then said he to me: \"He who from the cheek Thrusts out his beard upon his swarthy shoulders 84 \nWas, at the time when Greece was void of males, So that there scarce remained one in the cradle, An augur, and with Calchas gave the moment, In Aulis, when to sever the first cable. Eryphylus his name was, and so sings My lofty Tragedy in some part or other; That knowest thou well, who knowest the whole of it. The next, who is so slender in the flanks, Was Michael Scott, who of a verity Of magical illusions knew the game. Behold Guido Bonatti, behold Asdente, Who now unto his leather and his thread Would fain have stuck, but he too late repents. Behold the wretched ones, who left the needle, The spool and rock, and made them fortune-tellers; They wrought their magic spells with herb and image. But come now, for already holds the confines Of both the hemispheres, and under Seville Touches the ocean-wave, Cain and the thorns, And yesternight the moon was round already; Thou shouldst remember well it did not harm thee From time to time within the forest deep.\" Thus spake he to me, and we walked the while. 85",

      "original": "From bridge to bridge thus, speaking other things Of which my Comedy cares not to sing, We came along, and held the summit, when We halted to behold another fissure Of Malebolge and other vain laments; And I beheld it marvellously dark. As in the Arsenal of the Venetians Boils in the winter the tenacious pitch To smear their unsound vessels o'er again, For sail they cannot; and instead thereof One makes his vessel new, and one recaulks The ribs of that which many a voyage has made; One hammers at the prow, one at the stern, This one makes oars, and that one cordage twists, Another mends the mainsail and the mizzen; Thus, not by fire, but by the art divine, Was boiling down below there a dense pitch Which upon every side the bank belimed. I saw it, but I did not see within it Aught but the bubbles that the boiling raised, And all swell up and resubside compressed. The while below there fixedly I gazed, My Leader, crying out: \"Beware, beware!\" Drew me unto himself from where I stood. Then I turned round, as one who is impatient To see what it behoves him to escape, And whom a sudden terror doth unman, Who, while he looks, delays not his departure; And I beheld behind us a black devil, 86 Running along upon the crag, approach. Ah, how ferocious was he in his aspect! And how he seemed to me in action ruthless, With open wings and light upon his feet! His shoulders, which sharp-pointed were and high, A sinner did encumber with both haunches, And he held clutched the sinews of the feet. From off our bridge, he said: \"O Malebranche, Behold one of the elders of Saint Zita; Plunge him beneath, for I return for others Unto that town, which is well furnished with them. All there are barrators, except Bonturo; No into Yes for money there is changed.\" He hurled him down, and over the hard crag Turned round, and never was a mastiff loosened In so much hurry to pursue a thief. The other sank, and rose again face downward; But the demons, under cover of the bridge, Cried: \"Here the Santo Volto has no place! Here swims one otherwise than in the Serchio; Therefore, if for our gaffs thou wishest not, Do not uplift thyself above the pitch.\" They seized him then with more than a hundred rakes; They said: \"It here behoves thee to dance covered, That, if thou canst, thou secretly mayest pilfer.\" Not otherwise the cooks their scullions make Immerse into the middle of the caldron The meat with hooks, so that it may not float. Said the good Master to me: \"That it be not Apparent thou art here, crouch thyself down Behind a jag, that thou mayest have some screen; And for no outrage that is done to me Be thou afraid, because these things I know, For once before was I in such a scuffle.\" Then he passed on beyond the bridge's head, And as upon the sixth bank he arrived, Need was for him to have a steadfast front. With the same fury, and the same uproar, As dogs leap out upon a mendicant, Who on a sudden begs, where'er he stops, 87 \nThey issued from beneath the little bridge, And turned against him all their grappling-irons; But he cried out: \"Be none of you malignant! Before those hooks of yours lay hold of me, Let one of you step forward, who may hear me, And then take counsel as to grappling me.\" They all cried out: \"Let Malacoda go;\" Whereat one started, and the rest stood still, And he came to him, saying: \"What avails it?\" \"Thinkest thou, Malacoda, to behold me Advanced into this place,\" my Master said, \"Safe hitherto from all your skill of fence, Without the will divine, and fate auspicious? Let me go on, for it in Heaven is willed That I another show this savage road.\" Then was his arrogance so humbled in him, That he let fall his grapnel at his feet, And to the others said: \"Now strike him not.\" And unto me my Guide: \"O thou, who sittest Among the splinters of the bridge crouched down, Securely now return to me again.\" Wherefore I started and came swiftly to him; And all the devils forward thrust themselves, So that I feared they would not keep their compact. And thus beheld I once afraid the soldiers Who issued under safeguard from Caprona, Seeing themselves among so many foes. Close did I press myself with all my person Beside my Leader, and turned not mine eyes From off their countenance, which was not good. They lowered their rakes, and \"Wilt thou have me hit him,\" They said to one another, \"on the rump?\" And answered: \"Yes; see that thou nick him with it.\" But the same demon who was holding parley With my Conductor turned him very quickly, And said: \"Be quiet, be quiet, Scarmiglione;\" Then said to us: \"You can no farther go Forward upon this crag, because is lying All shattered, at the bottom, the sixth arch. And if it still doth please you to go onward, 88 \nPursue your way along upon this rock; Near is another crag that yields a path. Yesterday, five hours later than this hour, One thousand and two hundred sixty-six Years were complete, that here the way was broken. I send in that direction some of mine To see if any one doth air himself; Go ye with them; for they will not be vicious. Step forward, Alichino and Calcabrina,\" Began he to cry out, \"and thou, Cagnazzo; And Barbariccia, do thou guide the ten. Come forward, Libicocco and Draghignazzo, And tusked Ciriatto and Graffiacane, And Farfarello and mad Rubicante; Search ye all round about the boiling pitch; Let these be safe as far as the next crag, That all unbroken passes o'er the dens.\" \"O me! what is it, Master, that I see? Pray let us go,\" I said, \"without an escort, If thou knowest how, since for myself I ask none. If thou art as observant as thy wont is, Dost thou not see that they do gnash their teeth, And with their brows are threatening woe to us?\" And he to me: \"I will not have thee fear; Let them gnash on, according to their fancy, Because they do it for those boiling wretches.\" Along the left-hand dike they wheeled about; But first had each one thrust his tongue between His teeth towards their leader for a signal; And he had made a trumpet of his rump. 89",

We went upon our way with the ten demons; Ah, savage company! but in the church With saints, and in the tavern with the gluttons! Ever upon the pitch was my intent, To see the whole condition of that Bolgia, And of the people who therein were burned. Even as the dolphins, when they make a sign To mariners by arching of the back, That they should counsel take to save their vessel, Thus sometimes, to alleviate his pain, One of the sinners would display his back, And in less time conceal it than it lightens. As on the brink of water in a ditch The frogs stand only with their muzzles out, So that they hide their feet and other bulk, So upon every side the sinners stood; But ever as Barbariccia near them came, 90 Thus underneath the boiling they withdrew. I saw, and still my heart doth shudder at it, One waiting thus, even as it comes to pass One frog remains, and down another dives; And Graffiacan, who most confronted him, Grappled him by his tresses smeared with pitch, And drew him up, so that he seemed an otter. I knew, before, the names of all of them, So had I noted them when they were chosen, And when they called each other, listened how. \"O Rubicante, see that thou do lay Thy claws upon him, so that thou mayst flay him,\" Cried all together the accursed ones. And I: \"My Master, see to it, if thou canst, That thou mayst know who is the luckless wight, Thus come into his adversaries' hands.\" Near to the side of him my Leader drew, Asked of him whence he was; and he replied: \"I in the kingdom of Navarre was born; My mother placed me servant to a lord, For she had borne me to a ribald knave, Destroyer of himself and of his things. Then I domestic was of good King Thibault; I set me there to practise barratry, For which I pay the reckoning in this heat.\" And Ciriatto, from whose mouth projected, On either side, a tusk, as in a boar, Caused him to feel how one of them could rip. Among malicious cats the mouse had come; But Barbariccia clasped him in his arms, And said: \"Stand ye aside, while I enfork him.\" And to my Master he turned round his head; \"Ask him again,\" he said, \"if more thou wish To know from him, before some one destroy him.\" The Guide: \"Now tell then of the other culprits; Knowest thou any one who is a Latian, Under the pitch?\" And he: \"I separated Lately from one who was a neighbour to it; Would that I still were covered up with him, For I should fear not either claw nor hook!\" 91 \nAnd Libicocco: \"We have borne too much;\" And with his grapnel seized him by the arm, So that, by rending, he tore off a tendon. Eke Draghignazzo wished to pounce upon him Down at the legs; whence their Decurion Turned round and round about with evil look. When they again somewhat were pacified, Of him, who still was looking at his wound, Demanded my Conductor without stay: \"Who was that one, from whom a luckless parting Thou sayest thou hast made, to come ashore?\" And he replied: \"It was the Friar Gomita, He of Gallura, vessel of all fraud, Who had the enemies of his Lord in hand, And dealt so with them each exults thereat; Money he took, and let them smoothly off, As he says; and in other offices A barrator was he, not mean but sovereign. Foregathers with him one Don Michael Zanche Of Logodoro; and of Sardinia To gossip never do their tongues feel tired. O me! see that one, how he grinds his teeth; Still farther would I speak, but am afraid Lest he to scratch my itch be making ready.\" And the grand Provost, turned to Farfarello, Who rolled his eyes about as if to strike, Said: \"Stand aside there, thou malicious bird.\" \"If you desire either to see or hear,\" The terror-stricken recommenced thereon, \"Tuscans or Lombards, I will make them come. But let the Malebranche cease a little, So that these may not their revenges fear, And I, down sitting in this very place, For one that I am will make seven come, When I shall whistle, as our custom is To do whenever one of us comes out.\" Cagnazzo at these words his muzzle lifted, Shaking his head, and said: \"Just hear the trick Which he has thought of, down to throw himself!\" Whence he, who snares in great abundance had, 92 \nResponded: \"I by far too cunning am, When I procure for mine a greater sadness.\" Alichin held not in, but running counter Unto the rest, said to him: \"If thou dive, I will not follow thee upon the gallop, But I will beat my wings above the pitch; The height be left, and be the bank a shield To see if thou alone dost countervail us.\" O thou who readest, thou shalt hear new sport! Each to the other side his eyes averted; He first, who most reluctant was to do it. The Navarrese selected well his time; Planted his feet on land, and in a moment Leaped, and released himself from their design. Whereat each one was suddenly stung with shame, But he most who was cause of the defeat; Therefore he moved, and cried: \"Thou art o'ertakern.\" But little it availed, for wings could not Outstrip the fear; the other one went under, And, flying, upward he his breast directed; Not otherwise the duck upon a sudden Dives under, when the falcon is approaching, And upward he returneth cross and weary. Infuriate at the mockery, Calcabrina Flying behind him followed close, desirous The other should escape, to have a quarrel. And when the barrator had disappeared, He turned his talons upon his companion, And grappled with him right above the moat. But sooth the other was a doughty sparhawk To clapperclaw him well; and both of them Fell in the middle of the boiling pond. A sudden intercessor was the heat; But ne'ertheless of rising there was naught, To such degree they had their wings belimed. Lamenting with the others, Barbariccia Made four of them fly to the other side With all their gaffs, and very speedily This side and that they to their posts descended; They stretched their hooks towards the pitch-ensnared, 93 \nWho were already baked within the crust, And in this manner busied did we leave them. 94",

Get your claws on him!\nFlay his skin off!\" all the demons shrieked together.\n\n\"Master,\" I said, \"if you can manage it,\nfind out who this wretched soul might be,\nfallen into his enemies' hands.\"\n\nMy guide moved close beside the prisoner\nand asked where he was from. The man replied:\n\"I was born in the kingdom of Navarre.\nMy mother made me servant to a lord—\nshe'd conceived me with a worthless scoundrel\nwho destroyed both himself and everything he owned.\nLater I served good King Thibault's household,\nwhere I learned to practice graft and bribery.\nNow I pay for it in this blazing heat.\"\n\nCiriatto, whose mouth sprouted tusks\non either side like a wild boar's,\nlet the sinner feel how sharp they were.\nThe mouse had stumbled among vicious cats.\nBut Barbaricchia wrapped him in his arms\nand said, \"Stand back while I skewer him properly.\"\n\nThen he turned to my master: \"Ask him more,\nif you want to learn anything else from him\nbefore someone tears him apart.\"\n\nMy guide continued: \"Tell us about the others—\ndo you know any Italian souls\ntrapped under this pitch?\"\n\n\"I just left one,\" he answered,\n\"who came from a nearby region.\nI wish I were still hidden down there with him!\nThen I wouldn't fear these claws and hooks.\"\n\nLibicocco snarled, \"We've heard enough!\"\nHe seized the man's arm with his iron hook\nand ripped away a strip of muscle.\nDraghignazzo lunged toward his legs,\nbut their captain spun around,\nglaring with murderous eyes.\n\nWhen they had calmed down somewhat,\nmy conductor immediately questioned\nthe soul still staring at his fresh wound:\n\"Who was this one you mentioned,\nwhom you left so unluckily\nto come up on the shore?\"\n\n\"That was Friar Gomita of Gallura,\" he replied,\n\"a vessel overflowing with every kind of fraud.\nHe held his lord's enemies in his power\nbut treated them so well they all rejoiced—\ntook their money and let them slip away smoothly,\nas he tells it.

      "original": "Silent, alone, and without company We went, the one in front, the other after, As go the Minor Friars along their way. Upon the fable of Aesop was directed My thought, by reason of the present quarrel, Where he has spoken of the frog and mouse; For 'mo' and 'issa' are not more alike Than this one is to that, if well we couple End and beginning with a steadfast mind. And even as one thought from another springs, So afterward from that was born another, Which the first fear within me double made. Thus did I ponder: \"These on our account Are laughed to scorn, with injury and scoff So great, that much I think it must annoy them. If anger be engrafted on ill-will, They will come after us more merciless Than dog upon the leveret which he seizes,\" I felt my hair stand all on end already With terror, and stood backwardly intent, When said I: \"Master, if thou hidest not Thyself and me forthwith, of Malebranche I am in dread; we have them now behind us; I so imagine them, I already feel them.\" And he: \"If I were made of leaded glass, Thine outward image I should not attract Sooner to me than I imprint the inner. Just now thy thoughts came in among my own, With similar attitude and similar face, 95 So that of both one counsel sole I made. If peradventure the right bank so slope That we to the next Bolgia can descend, We shall escape from the imagined chase.\" Not yet he finished rendering such opinion, When I beheld them come with outstretched wings, Not far remote, with will to seize upon us. My Leader on a sudden seized me up, Even as a mother who by noise is wakened, And close beside her sees the enkindled flames, Who takes her son, and flies, and does not stop, Having more care of him than of herself, So that she clothes her only with a shift; And downward from the top of the hard bank Supine he gave him to the pendent rock, That one side of the other Bolgia walls. Ne'er ran so swiftly water through a sluice To turn the wheel of any land-built mill, When nearest to the paddles it approaches, As did my Master down along that border, Bearing me with him on his breast away, As his own son, and not as a companion. Hardly the bed of the ravine below His feet had reached, ere they had reached the hill Right over us; but he was not afraid; For the high Providence, which had ordained To place them ministers of the fifth moat, The power of thence departing took from all. A painted people there below we found, Who went about with footsteps very slow, Weeping and in their semblance tired and vanquished. They had on mantles with the hoods low down Before their eyes, and fashioned of the cut That in Cologne they for the monks are made. Without, they gilded are so that it dazzles; But inwardly all leaden and so heavy That Frederick used to put them on of straw. O everlastingly fatiguing mantle! Again we turned us, still to the left hand Along with them, intent on their sad plaint; 96 \nBut owing to the weight, that weary folk Came on so tardily, that we were new In company at each motion of the haunch. Whence I unto my Leader: \"See thou find Some one who may by deed or name be known, And thus in going move thine eye about.\" And one, who understood the Tuscan speech, Cried to us from behind: \"Stay ye your feet, Ye, who so run athwart the dusky air! Perhaps thou'lt have from me what thou demandest.\" Whereat the Leader turned him, and said: \"Wait, And then according to his pace proceed.\" I stopped, and two beheld I show great haste Of spirit, in their faces, to be with me; But the burden and the narrow way delayed them. When they came up, long with an eye askance They scanned me without uttering a word. Then to each other turned, and said together: \"He by the action of his throat seems living; And if they dead are, by what privilege Go they uncovered by the heavy stole?\" Then said to me: \"Tuscan, who to the college Of miserable hypocrites art come, Do not disdain to tell us who thou art.\" And I to them: \"Born was I, and grew up In the great town on the fair river of Arno, And with the body am I've always had. But who are ye, in whom there trickles down Along your cheeks such grief as I behold? And what pain is upon you, that so sparkles?\" And one replied to me: \"These orange cloaks Are made of lead so heavy, that the weights Cause in this way their balances to creak. Frati Gaudenti were we, and Bolognese; I Catalano, and he Loderingo Named, and together taken by thy city, As the wont is to take one man alone, For maintenance of its peace; and we were such That still it is apparent round Gardingo.\" \"O Friars,\" began I, \"your iniquitous… \" 97 \nBut said no more; for to mine eyes there rushed One crucified with three stakes on the ground. When me he saw, he writhed himself all over, Blowing into his beard with suspirations; And the Friar Catalan, who noticed this, Said to me: \"This transfixed one, whom thou seest, Counselled the Pharisees that it was meet To put one man to torture for the people. Crosswise and naked is he on the path, As thou perceivest; and he needs must feel, Whoever passes, first how much he weighs; And in like mode his father-in-law is punished Within this moat, and the others of the council, Which for the Jews was a malignant seed.\" And thereupon I saw Virgilius marvel O'er him who was extended on the cross So vilely in eternal banishment. Then he directed to the Friar this voice: \"Be not displeased, if granted thee, to tell us If to the right hand any pass slope down By which we two may issue forth from here, Without constraining some of the black angels To come and extricate us from this deep.\" Then he made answer: \"Nearer than thou hopest There is a rock, that forth from the great circle Proceeds, and crosses all the cruel valleys, Save that at this 'tis broken, and does not bridge it; You will be able to mount up the ruin, That sidelong slopes and at the bottom rises.\" The Leader stood awhile with head bowed down; Then said: \"The business badly he recounted Who grapples with his hook the sinners yonder.\" And the Friar: \"Many of the Devil's vices Once heard I at Bologna, and among them, That he's a liar and the father of lies.\" Thereat my Leader with great strides went on, Somewhat disturbed with anger in his looks; Whence from the heavy-laden I departed After the prints of his beloved feet. 98",
      "modern": "Silent, alone, without companions,\nwe walked single file—\none ahead, the other following behind,\nlike Franciscan friars on their way.\n\nThe present fight brought to mind\none of Aesop's fables,\nthe one about the frog and the mouse.\nThe words \"now\" and \"then\" aren't more alike\nthan that story is to our situation,\nif you compare how both begin and end.\n\nAnd as one thought leads to another,\nthis comparison sparked a new idea\nthat doubled my fear.\nI thought to myself: \"Because of us,\nthese demons have been mocked and humiliated,\nso badly injured and insulted\nthat it must really anger them.\nIf you add rage to their natural malice,\nthey'll chase us down more ruthlessly\nthan a dog attacking the rabbit it catches.\"\n\nI could already feel my hair\nstanding on end with terror.\nI kept looking back as I said,\n\"Master, unless you hide us both\nright now, I'm afraid of the Malebranche.\nThey're behind us—\nI can imagine them so clearly\nI can almost feel them coming.\"\n\nAnd he replied: \"Even if I were made\nof polished glass,\nI couldn't reflect your appearance\nfaster than I sense your inner thoughts.\nYour thoughts just merged with mine—\nthey have the same urgency, the same concern.\n\nSo I made one plan from both our thoughts:\n\"If perhaps the right bank slopes gently enough\nthat we can descend to the next ditch,\nwe'll escape this imagined pursuit.\"\n\nHe had barely finished voicing this idea\nwhen I saw them coming with outstretched wings,\nnot far away, intent on seizing us.\n\nMy guide suddenly swept me up,\nlike a mother wakened by crackling flames\nwho sees the fire blazing near her child—\nshe grabs her son and flees without stopping,\ncaring more for him than herself,\nnot even pausing to throw on more than her slip.\n\nDown from the ridge of that hard bank\nhe threw himself backward onto the hanging rock\nthat walls one side of the neighboring ditch.\n\nWater never ran so swiftly through a millrace\nto turn the wheel of a riverside mill\nwhen it rushes closest to the paddles\nas my master raced down that slope,\ncarrying me against his chest—\nnot like a companion, but like his own son.\n\nHis feet had barely touched the bottom\nwhen the demons reached the ridge above us,\nbut he felt no fear.\nHigh Providence, which made them guardians\nof the fifth ditch, strips from all of them\nthe power to leave their post.\n\nBelow we found a painted people\nwho walked with slow, weary steps,\nweeping, looking exhausted and defeated.\nThey wore cloaks with hoods pulled low\nover their eyes, cut in the same style\nas the monks' robes made in Cologne.\n\nOn the outside, they gleamed with gold that dazzled,\nbut inside they were all lead, so heavy\nthat Frederick's straw cloaks were featherweight by comparison.\nWhat an eternally exhausting garment!\n\nWe turned again, always to the left,\nwalking alongside them, listening to their sad laments.\nBut because of the weight, that weary crowd\nmoved so slowly that with every step\nwe found ourselves with new companions.\n\nSo I said to my leader: \"Try to find\nsomeone who might be known by deed or name—\nkeep your eyes moving as we walk.\"\n\nAnd one who recognized my Tuscan speech\ncalled out from behind: \"Stop, you two\nwho run so quickly through this dark air!\nPerhaps you'll get from me what you're looking for.\"\n\nMy leader turned and said: \"Wait,\nthen proceed according to his pace.\"\n\nI stopped and saw two souls showing\ngreat eagerness in their faces to reach me,\nbut their burden and the narrow path slowed them.\n\nWhen they arrived, they studied me sideways\nfor a long time without saying a word.\nThen they turned to each other and said:\n\"This one seems alive—see how his throat moves.\nAnd if they're dead, by what privilege\ndo they go uncovered by the heavy cloak?\"\n\nThen to me: \"Tuscan, you who have come\nto this college of wretched hypocrites,\ndon't disdain to tell us who you are.\"\n\nAnd I answered: \"I was born and raised\nin the great city on Arno's beautiful river,\nand I'm here in the body I've always had.\nBut who are you, from whose cheeks\nI see such grief trickling down?\nWhat punishment makes you glitter so?\"\n\nOne replied: \"These orange cloaks\nare made of lead so heavy\nthat we creak like scales under the weight.\nWe were Jovial Friars, both from Bologna—\nI am Catalano, he is Loderingo.\nYour city chose us both together,\nthough usually they pick just one man,\nto keep the peace.

      "original": "In that part of the youthful year wherein The Sun his locks beneath Aquarius tempers, And now the nights draw near to half the day, What time the hoar-frost copies on the ground The outward semblance of her sister white, But little lasts the temper of her pen, The husbandman, whose forage faileth him, Rises, and looks, and seeth the champaign All gleaming white, whereat he beats his flank, Returns in doors, and up and down laments, Like a poor wretch, who knows not what to do; Then he returns and hope revives again, Seeing the world has changed its countenance In little time, and takes his shepherd's crook, And forth the little lambs to pasture drives. Thus did the Master fill me with alarm, When I beheld his forehead so disturbed, And to the ailment came as soon the plaster. For as we came unto the ruined bridge, The Leader turned to me with that sweet look Which at the mountain's foot I first beheld. His arms he opened, after some advisement Within himself elected, looking first Well at the ruin, and laid hold of me. And even as he who acts and meditates, For aye it seems that he provides beforehand, So upward lifting me towards the summit Of a huge rock, he scanned another crag, Saying: \"To that one grapple afterwards, But try first if 'tis such that it will hold thee.\" 99 This was no way for one clothed with a cloak; For hardly we, he light, and I pushed upward, Were able to ascend from jag to jag. And had it not been, that upon that precinct Shorter was the ascent than on the other, He I know not, but I had been dead beat. But because Malebolge tow'rds the mouth Of the profoundest well is all inclining, The structure of each valley doth import That one bank rises and the other sinks. Still we arrived at length upon the point Wherefrom the last stone breaks itself asunder. The breath was from my lungs so milked away, When I was up, that I could go no farther, Nay, I sat down upon my first arrival. \"Now it behoves thee thus to put off sloth,\" My Master said; \"for sitting upon down, Or under quilt, one cometh not to fame, Withouten which whoso his life consumes Such vestige leaveth of himself on earth, As smoke in air or in the water foam. And therefore raise thee up, o'ercome the anguish With spirit that o'ercometh every battle, If with its heavy body it sink not. A longer stairway it behoves thee mount; 'Tis not enough from these to have departed; Let it avail thee, if thou understand me.\" Then I uprose, showing myself provided Better with breath than I did feel myself, And said: \"Go on, for I am strong and bold.\" Upward we took our way along the crag, Which jagged was, and narrow, and difficult, And more precipitous far than that before. Speaking I went, not to appear exhausted; Whereat a voice from the next moat came forth, Not well adapted to articulate words. I know not what it said, though o'er the back I now was of the arch that passes there; But he seemed moved to anger who was speaking. I was bent downward, but my living eyes 100 \nCould not attain the bottom, for the dark; Wherefore I: \"Master, see that thou arrive At the next round, and let us descend the wall; For as from hence I hear and understand not, So I look down and nothing I distinguish.\" \"Other response,\" he said, \"I make thee not, Except the doing; for the modest asking Ought to be followed by the deed in silence.\" We from the bridge descended at its head, Where it connects itself with the eighth bank, And then was manifest to me the Bolgia; And I beheld therein a terrible throng Of serpents, and of such a monstrous kind, That the remembrance still congeals my blood Let Libya boast no longer with her sand; For if Chelydri, Jaculi, and Phareae She breeds, with Cenchri and with Amphisbaena, Neither so many plagues nor so malignant E'er showed she with all Ethiopia, Nor with whatever on the Red Sea is! Among this cruel and most dismal throng People were running naked and affrighted. Without the hope of hole or heliotrope. They had their hands with serpents bound behind them; These riveted upon their reins the tail And head, and were in front of them entwined. And lo! at one who was upon our side There darted forth a serpent, which transfixed him There where the neck is knotted to the shoulders. Nor 'O' so quickly e'er, nor 'I' was written, As he took fire, and burned; and ashes wholly Behoved it that in falling he became. And when he on the ground was thus destroyed, The ashes drew together, and of themselves Into himself they instantly returned. Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed The phoenix dies, and then is born again, When it approaches its five-hundredth year; On herb or grain it feeds not in its life, But only on tears of incense and amomum, 101 \nAnd nard and myrrh are its last winding-sheet. And as he is who falls, and knows not how, By force of demons who to earth down drag him, Or other oppilation that binds man, When he arises and around him looks, Wholly bewildered by the mighty anguish Which he has suffered, and in looking sighs; Such was that sinner after he had risen. Justice of God! O how severe it is, That blows like these in vengeance poureth down! The Guide thereafter asked him who he was; Whence he replied: \"I rained from Tuscany A short time since into this cruel gorge. A bestial life, and not a human, pleased me, Even as the mule I was; I'm Vanni Fucci, Beast, and Pistoia was my worthy den.\" And I unto the Guide: \"Tell him to stir not, And ask what crime has thrust him here below, For once a man of blood and wrath I saw him.\" And the sinner, who had heard, dissembled not, But unto me directed mind and face, And with a melancholy shame was painted. Then said: \"It pains me more that thou hast caught me Amid this misery where thou seest me, Than when I from the other life was taken. What thou demandest I cannot deny; So low am I put down because I robbed The sacristy of the fair ornaments, And falsely once 'twas laid upon another; But that thou mayst not such a sight enjoy, If thou shalt e'er be out of the dark places, Thine ears to my announcement ope and hear: Pistoia first of Neri groweth meagre; Then Florence doth renew her men and manners; Mars draws a vapour up from Val di Magra, Which is with turbid clouds enveloped round, And with impetuous and bitter tempest Over Campo Picen shall be the battle; When it shall suddenly rend the mist asunder, So that each Bianco shall thereby be smitten. 102 \nAnd this I've said that it may give thee pain.\" 103",
      "modern": "In that season of the young year\nwhen the Sun softens his golden hair beneath Aquarius,\nand the nights begin to match the length of days—\nwhen hoarfrost sketches on the ground\nthe white image of her sister snow,\nthough her pen's ink runs thin and fades quickly—\n\nThe farmer, finding his fodder gone,\nrises and steps outside to see the fields\ngleaming white in every direction.\nHe strikes his thigh in dismay,\nreturns to his house, pacing and lamenting\nlike a lost soul who cannot find his way.\n\nBut soon he ventures out again, and hope returns\nas he sees how quickly the world has changed its face.\nHe takes up his shepherd's staff\nand drives his little lambs out to pasture.\n\nJust so my Master filled me with alarm\nwhen I saw his brow so deeply troubled—\nbut the remedy came as swiftly as the wound.\nWhen we reached the shattered bridge,\nhe turned to me with that gentle expression\nI had first seen at the mountain's base.\n\nAfter careful consideration,\nstudying the wreckage thoroughly,\nhe opened his arms and took hold of me.\nLike someone who plans while acting,\nalways thinking several moves ahead,\nhe lifted me up toward the summit of a massive boulder,\nthen examined the next rocky outcrop, saying:\n\"We'll grab onto that one next,\nbut first test if it will bear your weight.\"\n\nThis was no path for anyone wearing robes.\nEven with him being nimble and pushing me upward,\nwe could barely climb from jagged point to jagged point.\nHad the slope on this side not been shorter\nthan on the other bank,\nI cannot say about him, but I would have collapsed entirely.\n\nBut since all of Malebolge tilts downward\ntoward the mouth of the deepest pit,\neach valley's design ensures\nthat one wall rises while the other falls.\nEventually we reached the spot\nwhere the final stone breaks away.\n\nMy lungs were so drained of breath\nwhen I climbed up that I could go no further—\nI collapsed the moment I arrived.\n\n\"Now you must cast off laziness,\"\nmy Master said. \"Sitting on soft cushions\nor lying under quilts will never bring you fame.\nWithout fame, whoever wastes his life\nleaves no more trace of himself on earth\nthan smoke in air or foam on water.\n\nSo get up. Overcome this exhaustion\nwith the spirit that wins every battle,\nunless it lets the heavy body drag it down.\nYou have a much longer stairway yet to climb.\nIt's not enough to have left these souls behind.\nIf you understand me, let my words inspire you.\"\n\nI stood up, showing myself\nbetter supplied with breath than I actually felt,\nand said: \"Move on—I am strong and ready.\"\n\nWe continued up along the ridge,\nwhich was jagged, narrow, and treacherous,\nfar steeper than the one before.\nI kept talking as we walked, trying not to seem winded,\nwhen a voice emerged from the next ditch—\nsounds barely capable of forming words.\n\nI couldn't make out what it said,\nthough I stood on the arch that spans that place,\nbut whoever was speaking seemed moved to rage.\nI leaned down, but my living eyes\ncould not penetrate to the bottom through the darkness.\n\n\"Master,\" I said, \"make sure we reach\nthe next ridge and descend the wall.\nJust as I hear from here but cannot understand,\nso I look down but can make out nothing.\"\n\n\"I give you no answer,\" he replied,\n\"except action.

      "original": "At the conclusion of his words, the thief Lifted his hands aloft with both the figs, Crying: \"Take that, God, for at thee I aim them.\" From that time forth the serpents were my friends; For one entwined itself about his neck As if it said: \"I will not thou speak more;\" And round his arms another, and rebound him, Clinching itself together so in front, That with them he could not a motion make. Pistoia, ah, Pistoia! why resolve not To burn thyself to ashes and so perish, Since in ill-doing thou thy seed excellest? Through all the sombre circles of this Hell, Spirit I saw not against God so proud, Not he who fell at Thebes down from the walls! He fled away, and spake no further word; And I beheld a Centaur full of rage Come crying out: \"Where is, where is the scoffer?\" I do not think Maremma has so many Serpents as he had all along his back, As far as where our countenance begins. Upon the shoulders, just behind the nape, With wings wide open was a dragon lying, And he sets fire to all that he encounters. My Master said: \"That one is Cacus, who Beneath the rock upon Mount Aventine Created oftentimes a lake of blood. He goes not on the same road with his brothers, 104 By reason of the fraudulent theft he made Of the great herd, which he had near to him; Whereat his tortuous actions ceased beneath The mace of Hercules, who peradventure Gave him a hundred, and he felt not ten.\" While he was speaking thus, he had passed by, And spirits three had underneath us come, Of which nor I aware was, nor my Leader, Until what time they shouted: \"Who are you?\" On which account our story made a halt, And then we were intent on them alone. I did not know them; but it came to pass, As it is wont to happen by some chance, That one to name the other was compelled, Exclaiming: \"Where can Cianfa have remained?\" Whence I, so that the Leader might attend, Upward from chin to nose my finger laid. If thou art, Reader, slow now to believe What I shall say, it will no marvel be, For I who saw it hardly can admit it. As I was holding raised on them my brows, Behold! a serpent with six feet darts forth In front of one, and fastens wholly on him. With middle feet it bound him round the paunch, And with the forward ones his arms it seized; Then thrust its teeth through one cheek and the other; The hindermost it stretched upon his thighs, And put its tail through in between the two, And up behind along the reins outspread it. Ivy was never fastened by its barbs Unto a tree so, as this horrible reptile Upon the other's limbs entwined its own. Then they stuck close, as if of heated wax They had been made, and intermixed their colour; Nor one nor other seemed now what he was; E'en as proceedeth on before the flame Upward along the paper a brown colour, Which is not black as yet, and the white dies. The other two looked on, and each of them Cried out: \"O me, Agnello, how thou changest! 105 \nBehold, thou now art neither two nor one.\" Already the two heads had one become, When there appeared to us two figures mingled Into one face, wherein the two were lost. Of the four lists were fashioned the two arms, The thighs and legs, the belly and the chest Members became that never yet were seen. Every original aspect there was cancelled; Two and yet none did the perverted image Appear, and such departed with slow pace. Even as a lizard, under the great scourge Of days canicular, exchanging hedge, Lightning appeareth if the road it cross; Thus did appear, coming towards the bellies Of the two others, a small fiery serpent, Livid and black as is a peppercorn. And in that part whereat is first received Our aliment, it one of them transfixed; Then downward fell in front of him extended. The one transfixed looked at it, but said naught; Nay, rather with feet motionless he yawned, Just as if sleep or fever had assailed him. He at the serpent gazed, and it at him; One through the wound, the other through the mouth Smoked violently, and the smoke commingled. Henceforth be silent Lucan, where he mentions Wretched Sabellus and Nassidius, And wait to hear what now shall be shot forth. Be silent Ovid, of Cadmus and Arethusa; For if him to a snake, her to fountain, Converts he fabling, that I grudge him not; Because two natures never front to front Has he transmuted, so that both the forms To interchange their matter ready were. Together they responded in such wise, That to a fork the serpent cleft his tail, And eke the wounded drew his feet together. The legs together with the thighs themselves Adhered so, that in little time the juncture No sign whatever made that was apparent. 106 \nHe with the cloven tail assumed the figure The other one was losing, and his skin Became elastic, and the other's hard. I saw the arms draw inward at the armpits, And both feet of the reptile, that were short, Lengthen as much as those contracted were. Thereafter the hind feet, together twisted, Became the member that a man conceals, And of his own the wretch had two created. While both of them the exhalation veils With a new colour, and engenders hair On one of them and depilates the other, The one uprose and down the other fell, Though turning not away their impious lamps, Underneath which each one his muzzle changed. He who was standing drew it tow'rds the temples, And from excess of matter, which came thither, Issued the ears from out the hollow cheeks; What did not backward run and was retained Of that excess made to the face a nose, And the lips thickened far as was befitting. He who lay prostrate thrusts his muzzle forward, And backward draws the ears into his head, In the same manner as the snail its horns; And so the tongue, which was entire and apt For speech before, is cleft, and the bi-forked In the other closes up, and the smoke ceases. The soul, which to a reptile had been changed, Along the valley hissing takes to flight, And after him the other speaking sputters. Then did he turn upon him his new shoulders, And said to the other: \"I'll have Buoso run, Crawling as I have done, along this road.\" In this way I beheld the seventh ballast Shift and reshift, and here be my excuse The novelty, if aught my pen transgress. And notwithstanding that mine eyes might be Somewhat bewildered, and my mind dismayed, They could not flee away so secretly But that I plainly saw Puccio Sciancato; 107 \nAnd he it was who sole of three companions, Which came in the beginning, was not changed; The other was he whom thou, Gaville, weepest. 108",
      "modern": "When he finished speaking, the thief\nraised both hands high with his figs extended,\nshouting: \"Take this, God! I'm aiming them at you!\"\n\nFrom that moment, the serpents became my allies.\nOne coiled around his neck like a collar of hate,\nas if to say: \"No more words from you.\"\nAnother wrapped his arms, binding them tight,\nclinching itself so firmly across his chest\nthat he could not move a muscle.\n\nPistoia! Oh, Pistoia! Why don't you\nburn yourself to ash and disappear,\nsince you surpass your ancestors in evil?\nThrough all the dark circles of this Hell,\nI have seen no spirit so defiant against God—\nnot even him who fell from Thebes' high walls!\n\nThe bound man fled without another word.\nThen I saw a Centaur racing toward us,\nscreaming: \"Where is he?

Look how you transform!\nYou are neither two beings nor one!\"\n\nThe two heads had already become one\nwhen we saw two forms blending\ninto a single face where both were lost.\nFour arms became two,\nthighs and legs, chest and belly\nmerged into limbs never seen before.\n\nEvery original feature was erased.\nThe twisted image appeared\nas two and yet neither, departing slowly.\n\nJust as a lizard darts across the road\nunder the blazing summer sun,\nquick as lightning between the hedges—\nso appeared a small fiery serpent,\nblack and livid as a peppercorn,\nracing toward the bellies of the other two.\n\nIt struck one of them in that place\nwhere we first receive our nourishment,\nthen fell stretched out before him.\nThe pierced man stared but said nothing,\nstanding motionless, yawning\nas if overcome by sleep or fever.\n\nHe gazed at the serpent, it at him.\nOne through the wound, the other through its mouth,\nthey smoked violently, the vapors mingling.\n\nLet Lucan fall silent when he tells\nof wretched Sabellus and Nassidius—\nwait to hear what I witnessed.\nLet Ovid be quiet about Cadmus and Arethusa.\nThough he transformed one into snake, one into fountain,\nI don't envy him—he never transmuted\ntwo natures face to face, both forms\nready to exchange their very matter.\n\nThey responded to each other perfectly:\nthe serpent split its tail into a fork\nwhile the wounded man drew his feet together.\nHis legs and thighs fused so completely\nthat soon no trace of the seam remained visible.\n\nThe cleft tail took on the shape\nthe other was losing, its skin growing soft\nwhile the man's hardened.\nI watched arms shrink into armpits\nwhile the reptile's short feet lengthened\nexactly as much as the man's contracted.\n\nThe serpent's hind feet twisted together,\nbecoming the organ that men conceal,\nwhile from his own the wretch sprouted two legs.\n\nAs smoke veiled them both,\ncoloring them with new hues,\ngrowing hair on one, stripping it from the other,\none rose up while the other fell down—\nthough neither turned away their evil eyes\nbeneath which each changed his face.\n\nThe standing figure drew his features toward his temples,\nand from excess matter gathering there,\nears emerged from his smooth cheeks.\nWhat didn't flow backward but remained\nformed his nose, and thickened his lips\nto their proper size.\n\nThe prostrate one thrust his face forward,\npulling his ears back into his skull\nlike a snail retracting its horns.\nHis tongue, once whole and fit for speech,\nsplit in two, while the other's forked tongue\njoined together.

      "original": "O Florence, since thou art so great, That over sea and land thou beatest thy wings, And throughout Hell thy name is spread abroad! Among the thieves five citizens of thine Like these I found, whence shame comes unto me, And thou thereby to no great honour risest. But if when morn is near our dreams are true, Feel shalt thou in a little time from now What Prato, if none other, craves for thee. And if it now were, it were not too soon; Would that it were, seeing it needs must be, For 'twill aggrieve me more the more I age. We went our way, and up along the stairs The bourns had made us to descend before, Remounted my Conductor and drew me. And following the solitary path Among the rocks and ridges of the crag, The foot without the hand sped not at all. Then sorrowed I, and sorrow now again, When I direct my mind to what I saw, And more my genius curb than I am wont, That it may run not unless virtue guide it; So that if some good star, or better thing, Have given me good, I may myself not grudge it. As many as the hind (who on the hill Rests at the time when he who lights the world His countenance keeps least concealed from us, While as the fly gives place unto the gnat) Seeth the glow-worms down along the valley, 109 Perchance there where he ploughs and makes his vintage; With flames as manifold resplendent all Was the eighth Bolgia, as I grew aware As soon as I was where the depth appeared. And such as he who with the bears avenged him Beheld Elijah's chariot at departing, What time the steeds to heaven erect uprose, For with his eye he could not follow it So as to see aught else than flame alone, Even as a little cloud ascending upward, Thus each along the gorge of the intrenchment Was moving; for not one reveals the theft, And every flame a sinner steals away. I stood upon the bridge uprisen to see, So that, if I had seized not on a rock, Down had I fallen without being pushed. And the Leader, who beheld me so attent, Exclaimed: \"Within the fires the spirits are; Each swathes himself with that wherewith he burns.\" \"My Master,\" I replied, \"by hearing thee I am more sure; but I surmised already It might be so, and already wished to ask thee Who is within that fire, which comes so cleft At top, it seems uprising from the pyre Where was Eteocles with his brother placed.\" He answered me: \"Within there are tormented Ulysses and Diomed, and thus together They unto vengeance run as unto wrath. And there within their flame do they lament The ambush of the horse, which made the door Whence issued forth the Romans' gentle seed; Therein is wept the craft, for which being dead Deidamia still deplores Achilles, And pain for the Palladium there is borne.\" \"If they within those sparks possess the power To speak,\" I said, \"thee, Master, much I pray, And re-pray, that the prayer be worth a thousand, That thou make no denial of awaiting Until the horned flame shall hither come; Thou seest that with desire I lean towards it.\" 110 \nAnd he to me: \"Worthy is thy entreaty Of much applause, and therefore I accept it; But take heed that thy tongue restrain itself. Leave me to speak, because I have conceived That which thou wishest; for they might disdain Perchance, since they were Greeks, discourse of thine.\" When now the flame had come unto that point, Where to my Leader it seemed time and place, After this fashion did I hear him speak: \"O ye, who are twofold within one fire, If I deserved of you, while I was living, If I deserved of you or much or little When in the world I wrote the lofty verses, Do not move on, but one of you declare Whither, being lost, he went away to die.\" Then of the antique flame the greater horn, Murmuring, began to wave itself about Even as a flame doth which the wind fatigues. Thereafterward, the summit to and fro Moving as if it were the tongue that spake, It uttered forth a voice, and said: \"When I From Circe had departed, who concealed me More than a year there near unto Gaeta, Or ever yet Aeneas named it so, Nor fondness for my son, nor reverence For my old father, nor the due affection Which joyous should have made Penelope, Could overcome within me the desire I had to be experienced of the world, And of the vice and virtue of mankind; But I put forth on the high open sea With one sole ship, and that small company By which I never had deserted been. Both of the shores I saw as far as Spain, Far as Morocco, and the isle of Sardes, And the others which that sea bathes round about. I and my company were old and slow When at that narrow passage we arrived Where Hercules his landmarks set as signals, That man no farther onward should adventure. 111 \nOn the right hand behind me left I Seville, And on the other already had left Ceuta. 'O brothers, who amid a hundred thousand Perils,' I said, 'have come unto the West, To this so inconsiderable vigil Which is remaining of your senses still Be ye unwilling to deny the knowledge, Following the sun, of the unpeopled world. Consider ye the seed from which ye sprang; Ye were not made to live like unto brutes, But for pursuit of virtue and of knowledge.' So eager did I render my companions, With this brief exhortation, for the voyage, That then I hardly could have held them back. And having turned our stern unto the morning, We of the oars made wings for our mad flight, Evermore gaining on the larboard side. Already all the stars of the other pole The night beheld, and ours so very low It did not rise above the ocean floor. Five times rekindled and as many quenched Had been the splendour underneath the moon, Since we had entered into the deep pass, When there appeared to us a mountain, dim From distance, and it seemed to me so high As I had never any one beheld. Joyful were we, and soon it turned to weeping; For out of the new land a whirlwind rose, And smote upon the fore part of the ship. Three times it made her whirl with all the waters, At the fourth time it made the stern uplift, And the prow downward go, as pleased Another, Until the sea above us closed again.\" 112",
      "modern": "O Florence, since you are so mighty,\nbeating your wings over sea and land,\nyour name spreads even through Hell itself!\nAmong the thieves I found five of your citizens\njust like these, which brings me shame,\nand brings you no great honor.\n\nBut if our dreams near dawn speak truth,\nyou will soon feel what Prato wishes on you,\nif not worse from others.\nAnd if it happened now, it wouldn't be too soon—\nI wish it would, since it must come to pass,\nfor it will grieve me more as I grow older.\n\nWe turned and climbed back up the stairs\nthe ridges had given us to descend,\nmy guide leading, pulling me along.\nFollowing the lonely path\namong the rocks and crags,\nour feet could not move without our hands.\n\nI grieved then, and grieve again now\nwhen I turn my mind to what I saw,\nreining in my talent more than usual\nso it won't run wild without virtue guiding it.\nWhatever good star or better force\nhas given me this gift, may I not waste it.\n\nLike fireflies the farmer sees\nscattered through the valley below\nwhen he rests on the hillside\nat the hour when the sun\nhides his face least from us,\nwhen flies give way to gnats—\n\njust so, the eighth ditch blazed\nwith countless flames\nas soon as I could see down to its depths.\n\nLike Elisha, who watched the bears avenge him,\nseeing Elijah's chariot depart\nas the horses rose straight up to heaven—\nhis eyes could follow nothing but flame alone,\nlike a small cloud ascending—\n\nso each flame moved along the ditch's trench,\nfor none reveals what it steals away,\nand every flame conceals a sinner.\n\nI stood on the bridge, craning to see,\nso intent that without gripping the rock\nI would have fallen with no push at all.\nMy leader, seeing me so focused,\nsaid: \"The spirits are within those fires—\neach wraps himself in what burns him.\"\n\n\"Master,\" I replied, \"hearing you say it\nmakes me more certain, though I'd already guessed\nand wanted to ask you:\nWho burns in that flame split at the top\nlike fire rising from the funeral pyre\nwhere Eteocles lay with his brother?\"\n\nHe answered: \"Ulysses and Diomedes\nare tormented in there together,\nracing toward punishment as they once raced to war.\nWithin their flame they mourn\nthe trick of the wooden horse that opened the door\nfrom which Rome's noble bloodline issued forth.\nThey weep for the deception that left\nDeidamia still mourning her dead Achilles,\nand they suffer for stealing the Palladium.\"\n\n\"If those spirits in the flames can speak,\"\nI said, \"Master, I beg you urgently—\nand let my plea count for a thousand—\ndon't refuse to wait here\nuntil that twin-horned flame comes closer.\nYou see how I lean toward it with longing.\"\n\nAnd he replied: \"Your request deserves praise,\nso I accept it.\nBut keep your tongue in check.\nLet me do the talking—I understand\nwhat you want to know. But they might scorn\nyour words, since they were Greeks.\"\n\nWhen the flame reached the spot\nwhere my leader judged the time was right,\nI heard him speak like this:\n\n\"You who are two within one fire,\nif I earned anything from you while I lived,\nif I earned much or little from you\nwhen I wrote those lofty verses in the world,\ndon't move on—let one of you tell us\nwhere he went, lost, to meet his death.\"\n\nThe greater horn of that ancient flame\nbegan murmuring and swaying\nlike a flame buffeted by wind.\nThen, moving its tip back and forth\nlike a tongue speaking,\nit cast out a voice and said:\n\n\"After I left Circe, who kept me\nmore than a year near Gaeta\nbefore Aeneas gave it that name,\nneither tenderness for my son,\nnor duty to my aging father,\nnor the love I owed Penelope\nthat should have made her glad\ncould conquer the burning in me\nto experience the world\nand learn of human vice and virtue.\n\nI set out on the deep open sea\nwith just one ship and that small crew\nwho had never abandoned me.\nI saw both shores as far as Spain,\nas far as Morocco, and Sardinia,\nand all the other islands that sea bathes.\n\nMy men and I were old and slow\nwhen we reached that narrow strait\nwhere Hercules set up his pillars\nto warn that no man should go farther.\nOn my right I left Seville behind,\non my left I had already passed Ceuta.\n\n'Brothers,' I said, 'who through a hundred thousand\ndangers have reached the West,\ndon't deny yourselves the knowledge—\nfollowing the sun into the world without people—\nthat remains to this brief vigil\nof our senses that is left to us.\nConsider what you came from:\nyou weren't made to live like animals,\nbut to pursue virtue and knowledge.'\n\nI made my companions so eager\nwith this short speech\nthat I could hardly have held them back.\nTurning our stern toward the dawn,\nwe made wings of our oars\nfor that mad flight,\nalways gaining on the left side.\n\nNight already saw all the stars\nof the southern pole,\nand ours hung so low\nit never rose above the ocean floor.\nFive times the light beneath the moon\nhad been rekindled and quenched again\nsince we entered the deep pass,\nwhen a mountain appeared to us,\ndistant and dark,\nhigher than any I had ever seen.\n\nWe rejoiced, but joy quickly turned to grief,\nfor from that new land a whirlwind rose\nand struck our ship's bow.\nThree times it spun us around\nwith all the waters.\nOn the fourth, it lifted our stern high\nand plunged our prow down deep,\nas Someone willed,\nuntil the sea closed over us again.\"",

As the Sicilian bull (that bellowed first With the lament of him, and that was right, Who with his file had modulated it) Bellowed so with the voice of the afflicted, That, notwithstanding it was made of brass, Still it appeared with agony transfixed; Thus, by not having any way or issue At first from out the fire, to its own language Converted were the melancholy words. But afterwards, when they had gathered way Up through the point, giving it that vibration The tongue had given them in their passage out, We heard it said: \"O thou, at whom I aim My voice, and who but now wast speaking Lombard, Saying, 'Now go thy way, no more I urge thee,' Because I come perchance a little late, To stay and speak with me let it not irk thee; Thou seest it irks not me, and I am burning. If thou but lately into this blind world Hast fallen down from that sweet Latian land, Wherefrom I bring the whole of my transgression, Say, if the Romagnuols have peace or war, For I was from the mountains there between 113 Urbino and the yoke whence Tiber bursts.\" I still was downward bent and listening, When my Conductor touched me on the side, Saying: \"Speak thou: this one a Latian is.\" And I, who had beforehand my reply In readiness, forthwith began to speak: \"O soul, that down below there art concealed, Romagna thine is not and never has been Without war in the bosom of its tyrants; But open war I none have left there now. Ravenna stands as it long years has stood; The Eagle of Polenta there is brooding, So that she covers Cervia with her vans. The city which once made the long resistance, And of the French a sanguinary heap, Beneath the Green Paws finds itself again; Verrucchio's ancient Mastiff and the new, Who made such bad disposal of Montagna, Where they are wont make wimbles of their teeth. The cities of Lamone and Santerno Governs the Lioncel of the white lair, Who changes sides 'twixt summer-time and winter; And that of which the Savio bathes the flank, Even as it lies between the plain and mountain, Lives between tyranny and a free state. Now I entreat thee tell us who thou art; Be not more stubborn than the rest have been, So may thy name hold front there in the world.\" After the fire a little more had roared In its own fashion, the sharp point it moved This way and that, and then gave forth such breath: \"If I believed that my reply were made To one who to the world would e'er return, This flame without more flickering would stand still; But inasmuch as never from this depth Did any one return, if I hear true, Without the fear of infamy I answer, I was a man of arms, then Cordelier, Believing thus begirt to make amends; And truly my belief had been fulfilled 114 \nBut for the High Priest, whom may ill betide, Who put me back into my former sins; And how and wherefore I will have thee hear. While I was still the form of bone and pulp My mother gave to me, the deeds I did Were not those of a lion, but a fox. The machinations and the covert ways I knew them all, and practised so their craft, That to the ends of earth the sound went forth. When now unto that portion of mine age I saw myself arrived, when each one ought To lower the sails, and coil away the ropes, That which before had pleased me then displeased me; And penitent and confessing I surrendered, Ah woe is me! and it would have bestead me; The Leader of the modern Pharisees Having a war near unto Lateran, And not with Saracens nor with the Jews, For each one of his enemies was Christian, And none of them had been to conquer Acre, Nor merchandising in the Sultan's land, Nor the high office, nor the sacred orders, In him regarded, nor in me that cord Which used to make those girt with it more meagre; But even as Constantine sought out Sylvester To cure his leprosy, within Soracte, So this one sought me out as an adept To cure him of the fever of his pride. Counsel he asked of me, and I was silent, Because his words appeared inebriate. And then he said: 'Be not thy heart afraid; Henceforth I thee absolve; and thou instruct me How to raze Palestrina to the ground. Heaven have I power to lock and to unlock, As thou dost know; therefore the keys are two, The which my predecessor held not dear.' Then urged me on his weighty arguments There, where my silence was the worst advice; And said I: 'Father, since thou washest me Of that sin into which I now must fall, 115 \nThe promise long with the fulfilment short Will make thee triumph in thy lofty seat.' Francis came afterward, when I was dead, For me; but one of the black Cherubim Said to him: 'Take him not; do me no wrong; He must come down among my servitors, Because he gave the fraudulent advice From which time forth I have been at his hair; For who repents not cannot be absolved, Nor can one both repent and will at once, Because of the contradiction which consents not.' O miserable me! how I did shudder When he seized on me, saying: 'Peradventure Thou didst not think that I was a logician!' He bore me unto Minos, who entwined Eight times his tail about his stubborn back, And after he had bitten it in great rage, Said: 'Of the thievish fire a culprit this;' Wherefore, here where thou seest, am I lost, And vested thus in going I bemoan me.\" When it had thus completed its recital, The flame departed uttering lamentations, Writhing and flapping its sharp-pointed horn. Onward we passed, both I and my Conductor, Up o'er the crag above another arch, Which the moat covers, where is paid the fee By those who, sowing discord, win their burden. 116",
      "modern": "The flame stood upright and still,\nno longer speaking,\n\nWith the gentle Poet's permission, we had moved away from the previous soul\nwhen another flame behind it caught our attention,\ndrawing our eyes to its tip\nwhere a confused sound was emerging.\n\nLike the Sicilian bull—that first bellowed\nwith the cries of its creator,\nthe man who shaped it with his tools—\nso this flame roared with the voice of the damned.\nThough made of brass, that ancient torture device\nseemed pierced through with agony.\nHere too, having no other way or opening\nto escape the fire at first,\nthe sorrowful words were converted into the flame's own language.\n\nBut once they found their path\nup through the tip, giving it the same vibration\nthe tongue had given them as they passed out,\nwe heard it say: \"O you, toward whom I direct\nmy voice, who just now spoke in Lombard dialect,\nsaying 'Go now, I urge you no further'—\nthough I may come perhaps a little late,\ndon't let it trouble you to stay and speak with me.\nYou see it doesn't trouble me, and I am burning!\n\nIf you have only recently fallen\ninto this blind world from that sweet Italian land\nfrom which I bring all my guilt,\ntell me—do the people of Romagna have peace or war?\nI was from the mountains between\nUrbino and the ridge where the Tiber springs forth.\"\n\nI was still leaning down and listening\nwhen my Guide touched me on the side,\nsaying: \"You speak—this one is Italian.\"\n\nSince I had my answer ready,\nI began at once to speak:\n\"O soul concealed down there below,\nyour Romagna never has been\nand never will be without war\nin the hearts of its tyrants,\nbut I left no open warfare there just now.\n\nRavenna stands as it has for many years—\nPolenta's Eagle broods there,\ncovering Cervia with its wings.\nThe city that once made the long resistance\nand left the French in bloody heaps\nnow finds itself again under the Green Claws.\nThe old Mastiff of Verrucchio and the young one\nwho dealt so badly with Montagna\nstill sharpen their teeth where they're accustomed.\n\nThe cities along the Lamone and Santerno rivers\nare governed by the little Lion of the white den,\nwho changes sides between summer and winter.\nAnd the city whose flank the Savio bathes,\nlying as it does between plain and mountain,\nlives between tyranny and freedom.\n\nNow I beg you, tell us who you are.\nDon't be more stubborn than others have been—\nso may your name endure in the world above.\"\n\nAfter the fire had roared a little more\nin its own way, it moved its sharp point\nback and forth, then released this breath:\n\n\"If I believed my answer were being given\nto someone who might return to the world,\nthis flame would cease its flickering.\nBut since no one has ever returned\nfrom this depth, if what I hear is true,\nI answer you without fear of infamy.\n\nI was a man of war, then became a Franciscan,\nbelieving that by wearing the cord I could make amends.\nAnd truly my belief would have been fulfilled,\nbut for the High Priest—may evil befall him!—\nwho drew me back into my former sins.\nHow and why this happened, I want you to hear.\n\nWhile I still possessed the form\nof bone and flesh my mother gave me,\nmy deeds were not those of a lion, but of a fox.\nI knew all the schemes and secret ways,\nand practiced their craft so well\nthat my reputation reached the ends of the earth.\n\nWhen I saw myself arrived at that time of life\nwhen everyone ought to lower the sails\nand coil up the ropes,\nwhat had once pleased me then displeased me.\nPenitent and confessing, I surrendered to God—\nalas for me! and it would have saved me.\n\nBut the Leader of the modern Pharisees,\nwaging war near the Lateran—\nnot against Saracens or Jews,\nfor all his enemies were Christians,\nnone of whom had gone to conquer Acre\nor traded in the Sultan's lands—\nregarded neither his high office nor holy orders,\nnor the cord I wore that used to make its wearers lean.\n\nJust as Constantine sought out Pope Sylvester\nin Mount Soracte to cure his leprosy,\nso this Pope sought me out as an expert\nto cure the fever of his pride.\nHe asked my counsel, and I kept silent\nbecause his words seemed drunk with madness.\n\nThen he said: 'Don't let your heart be afraid.\nFrom now on, I absolve you.

      "original": "Who ever could, e'en with untrammelled words, Tell of the blood and of the wounds in full Which now I saw, by many times narrating? Each tongue would for a certainty fall short By reason of our speech and memory, That have small room to comprehend so much. If were again assembled all the people Which formerly upon the fateful land Of Puglia were lamenting for their blood Shed by the Romans and the lingering war That of the rings made such illustrious spoils, As Livy has recorded, who errs not, With those who felt the agony of blows By making counterstand to Robert Guiscard, And all the rest, whose bones are gathered still At Ceperano, where a renegade Was each Apulian, and at Tagliacozzo, Where without arms the old Alardo conquered, And one his limb transpierced, and one lopped off, Should show, it would be nothing to compare With the disgusting mode of the ninth Bolgia. A cask by losing centre-piece or cant Was never shattered so, as I saw one Rent from the chin to where one breaketh wind. Between his legs were hanging down his entrails; His heart was visible, and the dismal sack That maketh excrement of what is eaten. While I was all absorbed in seeing him, He looked at me, and opened with his hands 117 His bosom, saying: \"See now how I rend me; How mutilated, see, is Mahomet; In front of me doth Ali weeping go, Cleft in the face from forelock unto chin; And all the others whom thou here beholdest, Disseminators of scandal and of schism While living were, and therefore are cleft thus. A devil is behind here, who doth cleave us Thus cruelly, unto the falchion's edge Putting again each one of all this ream, When we have gone around the doleful road; By reason that our wounds are closed again Ere any one in front of him repass. But who art thou, that musest on the crag, Perchance to postpone going to the pain That is adjudged upon thine accusations?\" \"Nor death hath reached him yet, nor guilt doth bring him,\" My Master made reply, \"to be tormented; But to procure him full experience, Me, who am dead, behoves it to conduct him Down here through Hell, from circle unto circle; And this is true as that I speak to thee.\" More than a hundred were there when they heard him, Who in the moat stood still to look at me, Through wonderment oblivious of their torture. \"Now say to Fra Dolcino, then, to arm him, Thou, who perhaps wilt shortly see the sun, If soon he wish not here to follow me, So with provisions, that no stress of snow May give the victory to the Novarese, Which otherwise to gain would not be easy.\" After one foot to go away he lifted, This word did Mahomet say unto me, Then to depart upon the ground he stretched it. Another one, who had his throat pierced through, And nose cut off close underneath the brows, And had no longer but a single ear, Staying to look in wonder with the others, Before the others did his gullet open, Which outwardly was red in every part, 118 \nAnd said: \"O thou, whom guilt doth not condemn, And whom I once saw up in Latian land, Unless too great similitude deceive me, Call to remembrance Pier da Medicina, If e'er thou see again the lovely plain That from Vercelli slopes to Marcabo, And make it known to the best two of Fano, To Messer Guido and Angiolello likewise, That if foreseeing here be not in vain, Cast over from their vessel shall they be, And drowned near unto the Cattolica, By the betrayal of a tyrant fell. Between the isles of Cyprus and Majorca Neptune ne'er yet beheld so great a crime, Neither of pirates nor Argolic people. That traitor, who sees only with one eye, And holds the land, which some one here with me Would fain be fasting from the vision of, Will make them come unto a parley with him; Then will do so, that to Focara's wind They will not stand in need of vow or prayer.\" And I to him: \"Show to me and declare, If thou wouldst have me bear up news of thee, Who is this person of the bitter vision.\" Then did he lay his hand upon the jaw Of one of his companions, and his mouth Oped, crying: \"This is he, and he speaks not. This one, being banished, every doubt submerged In Caesar by affirming the forearmed Always with detriment allowed delay.\" O how bewildered unto me appeared, With tongue asunder in his windpipe slit, Curio, who in speaking was so bold! And one, who both his hands dissevered had, The stumps uplifting through the murky air, So that the blood made horrible his face, Cried out: \"Thou shalt remember Mosca also, Who said, alas! 'A thing done has an end!' Which was an ill seed for the Tuscan people.\" \"And death unto thy race,\" thereto I added; 119 \nWhence he, accumulating woe on woe, Departed, like a person sad and crazed. But I remained to look upon the crowd; And saw a thing which I should be afraid, Without some further proof, even to recount, If it were not that conscience reassures me, That good companion which emboldens man Beneath the hauberk of its feeling pure. I truly saw, and still I seem to see it, A trunk without a head walk in like manner As walked the others of the mournful herd. And by the hair it held the head dissevered, Hung from the hand in fashion of a lantern, And that upon us gazed and said: \"O me!\" It of itself made to itself a lamp, And they were two in one, and one in two; How that can be, He knows who so ordains it. When it was come close to the bridge's foot, It lifted high its arm with all the head, To bring more closely unto us its words, Which were: \"Behold now the sore penalty, Thou, who dost breathing go the dead beholding; Behold if any be as great as this. And so that thou may carry news of me, Know that Bertram de Born am I, the same Who gave to the Young King the evil comfort. I made the father and the son rebellious; Achitophel not more with Absalom And David did with his accursed goadings. Because I parted persons so united, Parted do I now bear my brain, alas! From its beginning, which is in this trunk. Thus is observed in me the counterpoise.\" 120",
      "modern": "Who could ever tell,\neven with words set free,\nof all the blood and wounds\n\nHow could I ever tell in full what I witnessed there,\neven by telling it a thousand times over?\nEvery tongue would surely fail,\nour speech and memory too small\nto hold such vastness.\n\nIf all the people who once shed their blood\non Puglia's cursed ground could be gathered—\nthose who died under Roman swords\nand in that endless war\nthat left such piles of rings as spoils,\nas Livy recorded without error,\nalong with those who suffered agonizing wounds\nfighting against Robert Guiscard,\nand

on the ridge?\nPerhaps delaying your descent\nto the punishment decreed for your sins?\"\n\nMy master replied: \"Death has not yet reached him,\nnor does guilt bring him here to be tormented.\nTo give him complete knowledge,\nI, who am dead, must lead him\ndown through Hell from circle to circle.\nThis is as true as my speaking to you.\"\n\nMore than a hundred souls stopped still in the ditch\nwhen they heard this, staring at me\nin amazement, forgetting their torture.\n\n\"Tell Fra Dolcino, then—you who may see the sun again soon—\nto arm himself with provisions\nif he doesn't want to follow me here quickly.\nOtherwise the snow will give victory to the Novarese,\nwhich would not be easy to achieve by force alone.\"\n\nAfter lifting one foot to leave,\nMohammed spoke these words to me,\nthen stretched it to the ground and departed.\n\nAnother soul, his throat pierced through,\nnose cut off just below the eyebrows,\nwith only one ear remaining,\nstopped to stare in wonder with the others.\nBefore the rest, he opened his gullet—\nred all over on the outside—and said:\n\n\"O you whom guilt does not condemn,\nI once saw you in the land of Italy,\nunless great resemblance deceives me.\nRemember Pier da Medicina\nif you ever see again that lovely plain\nsloping from Vercelli to Marcabò.\n\nMake it known to Fano's two finest men,\nMesser Guido and Angiolello,\nthat unless our foresight here is worthless,\nthey will be thrown from their ship\nand drowned near Cattolica\nby a fell tyrant's betrayal.\n\nBetween Cyprus and Majorca\nNeptune never witnessed so great a

vision?\"\n\nThen he placed his hand on the jaw\nof one of his companions and opened his mouth,\ncrying: \"This is the one—he cannot speak.\nThis man, in exile, drowned every doubt in

      "original": "The many people and the divers wounds These eyes of mine had so inebriated, That they were wishful to stand still and weep; But said Virgilius: \"What dost thou still gaze at? Why is thy sight still riveted down there Among the mournful, mutilated shades? Thou hast not done so at the other Bolge; Consider, if to count them thou believest, That two-and-twenty miles the valley winds, And now the moon is underneath our feet; Henceforth the time allotted us is brief, And more is to be seen than what thou seest.\" \"If thou hadst,\" I made answer thereupon, \"Attended to the cause for which I looked, Perhaps a longer stay thou wouldst have pardoned.\" Meanwhile my Guide departed, and behind him I went, already making my reply, And superadding: \"In that cavern where I held mine eyes with such attention fixed, I think a spirit of my blood laments The sin which down below there costs so much.\" Then said the Master: \"Be no longer broken Thy thought from this time forward upon him; Attend elsewhere, and there let him remain; For him I saw below the little bridge, Pointing at thee, and threatening with his finger Fiercely, and heard him called Geri del Bello. So wholly at that time wast thou impeded By him who formerly held Altaforte, 121 Thou didst not look that way; so he departed.\" \"O my Conductor, his own violent death, Which is not yet avenged for him,\" I said, \"By any who is sharer in the shame, Made him disdainful; whence he went away, As I imagine, without speaking to me, And thereby made me pity him the more.\" Thus did we speak as far as the first place Upon the crag, which the next valley shows Down to the bottom, if there were more light. When we were now right over the last cloister Of Malebolge, so that its lay-brothers Could manifest themselves unto our sight, Divers lamentings pierced me through and through, Which with compassion had their arrows barbed, Whereat mine ears I covered with my hands. What pain would be, if from the hospitals Of Valdichiana, 'twixt July and September, And of Maremma and Sardinia All the diseases in one moat were gathered, Such was it here, and such a stench came from it As from putrescent limbs is wont to issue. We had descended on the furthest bank From the long crag, upon the left hand still, And then more vivid was my power of sight Down tow'rds the bottom, where the ministress Of the high Lord, Justice infallible, Punishes forgers, which she here records. I do not think a sadder sight to see Was in Aegina the whole people sick, (When was the air so full of pestilence, The animals, down to the little worm, All fell, and afterwards the ancient people, According as the poets have affirmed, Were from the seed of ants restored again,) Than was it to behold through that dark valley The spirits languishing in divers heaps. This on the belly, that upon the back One of the other lay, and others crawling Shifted themselves along the dismal road. 122 \nWe step by step went onward without speech, Gazing upon and listening to the sick Who had not strength enough to lift their bodies. I saw two sitting leaned against each other, As leans in heating platter against platter, From head to foot bespotted o'er with scabs; And never saw I plied a currycomb By stable-boy for whom his master waits, Or him who keeps awake unwillingly, As every one was plying fast the bite Of nails upon himself, for the great rage Of itching which no other succour had. And the nails downward with them dragged the scab, In fashion as a knife the scales of bream, Or any other fish that has them largest. \"O thou, that with thy fingers dost dismail thee,\" Began my Leader unto one of them, \"And makest of them pincers now and then, Tell me if any Latian is with those Who are herein; so may thy nails suffice thee To all eternity unto this work.\" \"Latians are we, whom thou so wasted seest, Both of us here,\" one weeping made reply; \"But who art thou, that questionest about us?\" And said the Guide: \"One am I who descends Down with this living man from cliff to cliff, And I intend to show Hell unto him.\" Then broken was their mutual support, And trembling each one turned himself to me, With others who had heard him by rebound. Wholly to me did the good Master gather, Saying: \"Say unto them whate'er thou wishest.\" And I began, since he would have it so: \"So may your memory not steal away In the first world from out the minds of men, But so may it survive 'neath many suns, Say to me who ye are, and of what people; Let not your foul and loathsome punishment Make you afraid to show yourselves to me.\" \"I of Arezzo was,\" one made reply, 123 \n\"And Albert of Siena had me burned; But what I died for does not bring me here. 'Tis true I said to him, speaking in jest, That I could rise by flight into the air, And he who had conceit, but little wit, Would have me show to him the art; and only Because no Daedalus I made him, made me Be burned by one who held him as his son. But unto the last Bolgia of the ten, For alchemy, which in the world I practised, Minos, who cannot err, has me condemned.\" And to the Poet said I: \"Now was ever So vain a people as the Sienese? Not for a certainty the French by far.\" Whereat the other leper, who had heard me, Replied unto my speech: \"Taking out Stricca, Who knew the art of moderate expenses, And Niccolo, who the luxurious use Of cloves discovered earliest of all Within that garden where such seed takes root; And taking out the band, among whom squandered Caccia d'Ascian his vineyards and vast woods, And where his wit the Abbagliato proffered!

      "modern": "The multitude of people and their various wounds\nhad so overwhelmed my eyes\nthat they longed to stop and weep.\n\nBut Virgil said: \"Why do you keep staring?\nWhy does your gaze remain fixed downward\n\nThere among the mournful, mutilated souls?\nYou haven't lingered like this at the other ditches.\nConsider this, if you think you can count them all—\nthe valley winds for twenty-two miles around,\nand the moon is already beneath our feet.\nThe time we have left grows short,\nand there's more to see than what you're staring at.\"\n\n\"If you had understood,\" I answered then,\n\"the reason why I looked so intently,\nperhaps you would have pardoned a longer stay.\"\nMeanwhile my guide moved on, and I followed,\nalready forming my reply as I added:\n\"In that pit where I fixed my gaze so steadily,\nI believe a spirit of my own blood grieves\nfor the sin that costs so dearly down there.\"\n\nThen my master said: \"Don't let your thoughts\nbe troubled by him anymore.\nTurn your attention elsewhere and leave him there.\nI saw him at the foot of the little bridge,\npointing at you and shaking his finger\nwith fierce threats. I heard him called Geri del Bello.\nYou were so completely absorbed then\nby the one who once ruled Altaforte\nthat you didn't look his way, and so he left.\"\n\n\"My guide,\" I said, \"his violent death,\nstill unavenged by any who shares\nin the family shame, filled him with scorn.\nThat's why he went away, I imagine,\nwithout speaking to me,\nand this makes me pity him all the more.\"\n\nWe spoke this way until we reached the first ledge\nof the ridge that reveals the next valley\ndown to its bottom, if there were more light.\nWhen we stood directly over the final cloister\nof Malebolge, so that its suffering brothers\ncould show themselves to our sight,\nstrange lamentations pierced me through and through—\narrows barbed with such compassion\nthat I covered my ears with my hands.\n\nImagine the pain if all the diseases\nfrom the hospitals of Valdichiana\nbetween July and September,\nand from Maremma and Sardinia,\nwere gathered in a single ditch—\nsuch was the agony here, and such a stench rose up\nas usually comes from rotting limbs.\n\nWe descended to the farthest bank\nof the long ridge, still keeping to the left,\nand then my sight grew sharper\nas I looked down toward the bottom, where the minister\nof the high Lord—infallible Justice—\npunishes the forgers she registers here.\n\nI don't think there was a sadder sight\nthan when all the people of Aegina fell sick—\nwhen the air was so thick with pestilence\nthat every creature, down to the smallest worm, died,\nand afterward the ancient people,\nas the poets tell us,\nwere restored from the seed of ants—\nthan seeing through that dark valley\nthe spirits languishing in scattered heaps.\n\nOne lay on another's belly, another on his back,\nand others crawled along\nshifting themselves down the wretched path.\nStep by step we walked on without speaking,\nwatching and listening to the sick\nwho lacked the strength to lift their bodies.\n\nI saw two sitting propped against each other\nlike pans leaning together over a fire,\nspotted from head to foot with scabs.\nI never saw a stable boy wielding a currycomb\nfor his impatient master,\nor someone forced to stay awake against his will,\nscrape as furiously as each of these\nclawed at himself with his nails\nin the maddening itch that had no other cure.\n\nTheir nails dragged the scabs downward\nthe way a knife scrapes scales from a bream\nor any other fish with large ones.\n\n\"You there, tearing yourself apart with your fingers,\"\nmy leader began, addressing one of them,\n\"and sometimes making pincers of them—\ntell us if there are any Italians\namong those here, and may your nails suffice\nfor this work through all eternity.\"\n\n\"We are Italians, both of us you see so wasted,\"\none replied, weeping, \"but who are you\nto ask about us?\"\n\nMy guide answered: \"I am one who descends\nfrom ledge to ledge with this living man,\nand I intend to show him Hell.\"\n\nThen their mutual support broke apart,\nand each turned toward me trembling,\nalong with others who heard his words echo.\nMy good master drew close to me, saying:\n\"Tell them whatever you wish.\"\n\nSince he wanted me to speak, I began:\n\"So may your memory not fade away\nfrom human minds in the first world,\nbut survive beneath many suns—\ntell me who you are and from what people.\nDon't let your foul and loathsome punishment\nmake you afraid to reveal yourselves to me.\"\n\n\"I was from Arezzo,\" one replied,\n\"and Albert of Siena had me burned.\nBut what I died for doesn't bring me here.\nIt's true I told him, speaking as a joke,\nthat I could rise into the air by flight,\nand he—who had great curiosity but little sense—\nwanted me to show him the art.\nSimply because I couldn't make him Daedalus,\nhe had me burned by one who treated him like a son.\nBut to this last ditch of the ten,\nfor the alchemy I practiced in the world,\nMinos, who cannot err, has condemned me.\"\n\nI said to the poet: \"Was there ever\na people as vain as the Sienese?\nCertainly not the French, by far.\"\n\nAt this the other leper, who had heard me,\nresponded to my words: \"Except for Stricca,\nwho knew the art of spending moderately,\nand Niccolò, who first discovered\nthe costly custom of cloves\nin that garden where such habits take root,\nand except for the company among whom\nCaccia d'Asciano squandered his vineyards and great woods,\nand where Abbagliato displayed his wit!\nBut so you'll know who seconds you\nagainst the Sienese, sharpen your eyes toward me\nso my face can answer you clearly—\nthen you'll see I am the shade of Capocchio,\nwho falsified metals through alchemy.\nYou must remember, if I see you rightly,\nhow skilled an ape of nature I was.\"",

      "original": "the time when Juno was enraged, For Semele, against the Theban blood, As she already more than once had shown, So reft of reason Athamas became, That, seeing his own wife with children twain Walking encumbered upon either hand, He cried: \"Spread out the nets, that I may take The lioness and her whelps upon the passage;\" And then extended his unpitying claws, Seizing the first, who had the name Learchus, And whirled him round, and dashed him on a rock; And she, with the other burthen, drowned herself;— And at the time when fortune downward hurled The Trojan's arrogance, that all things dared, So that the king was with his kingdom crushed, Hecuba sad, disconsolate, and captive, When lifeless she beheld Polyxena, And of her Polydorus on the shore Of ocean was the dolorous one aware, Out of her senses like a dog she barked, So much the anguish had her mind distorted; But not of Thebes the furies nor the Trojan Were ever seen in any one so cruel In goading beasts, and much more human members, As I beheld two shadows pale and naked, Who, biting, in the manner ran along That a boar does, when from the sty turned loose. One to Capocchio came, and by the nape Seized with its teeth his neck, so that in dragging 125 It made his belly grate the solid bottom. And the Aretine, who trembling had remained, Said to me: \"That mad sprite is Gianni Schicchi, And raving goes thus harrying other people.\" \"O,\" said I to him, \"so may not the other Set teeth on thee, let it not weary thee To tell us who it is, ere it dart hence.\" And he to me: \"That is the ancient ghost Of the nefarious Myrrha, who became Beyond all rightful love her father's lover. She came to sin with him after this manner, By counterfeiting of another's form; As he who goeth yonder undertook, That he might gain the lady of the herd, To counterfeit in himself Buoso Donati, Making a will and giving it due form.\" And after the two maniacs had passed On whom I held mine eye, I turned it back To look upon the other evil-born. I saw one made in fashion of a lute, If he had only had the groin cut off Just at the point at which a man is forked. The heavy dropsy, that so disproportions The limbs with humours, which it ill concocts, That the face corresponds not to the belly, Compelled him so to hold his lips apart As does the hectic, who because of thirst One tow'rds the chin, the other upward turns. \"O ye, who without any torment are, And why I know not, in the world of woe,\" He said to us, \"behold, and be attentive Unto the misery of Master Adam; I had while living much of what I wished, And now, alas! a drop of water crave. The rivulets, that from the verdant hills Of Cassentin descend down into Arno, Making their channels to be cold and moist, Ever before me stand, and not in vain; For far more doth their image dry me up Than the disease which strips my face of flesh. 126 \nThe rigid justice that chastises me Draweth occasion from the place in which I sinned, to put the more my sighs in flight. There is Romena, where I counterfeited The currency imprinted with the Baptist, For which I left my body burned above. But if I here could see the tristful soul Of Guido, or Alessandro, or their brother, For Branda's fount I would not give the sight. One is within already, if the raving Shades that are going round about speak truth; But what avails it me, whose limbs are tied? If I were only still so light, that in A hundred years I could advance one inch, I had already started on the way, Seeking him out among this squalid folk, Although the circuit be eleven miles, And be not less than half a mile across. For them am I in such a family; They did induce me into coining florins, Which had three carats of impurity.\" And I to him: \"Who are the two poor wretches That smoke like unto a wet hand in winter, Lying there close upon thy right-hand confines?\" \"I found them here,\" replied he, \"when I rained Into this chasm, and since they have not turned, Nor do I think they will for evermore. One the false woman is who accused Joseph, The other the false Sinon, Greek of Troy; From acute fever they send forth such reek.\" And one of them, who felt himself annoyed At being, peradventure, named so darkly, Smote with the fist upon his hardened paunch. It gave a sound, as if it were a drum; And Master Adam smote him in the face, With arm that did not seem to be less hard, Saying to him: \"Although be taken from me All motion, for my limbs that heavy are, I have an arm unfettered for such need.\" Whereat he answer made: \"When thou didst go 127 \nUnto the fire, thou hadst it not so ready: But hadst it so and more when thou wast coining.\" The dropsical: \"Thou sayest true in that; But thou wast not so true a witness there, Where thou wast questioned of the truth at Troy.\" \"If I spake false, thou falsifiedst the coin,\" Said Sinon; \"and for one fault I am here, And thou for more than any other demon.\" \"Remember, perjurer, about the horse,\" He made reply who had the swollen belly, \"And rueful be it thee the whole world knows it.\" \"Rueful to thee the thirst be wherewith cracks Thy tongue,\" the Greek said, \"and the putrid water That hedges so thy paunch before thine eyes.\" Then the false-coiner: \"So is gaping wide Thy mouth for speaking evil, as 'tis wont; Because if I have thirst, and humour stuff me Thou hast the burning and the head that aches, And to lick up the mirror of Narcissus Thou wouldst not want words many to invite thee.\" In listening to them was I wholly fixed, When said the Master to me: \"Now just look, For little wants it that I quarrel with thee.\" When him I heard in anger speak to me, I turned me round towards him with such shame That still it eddies through my memory. And as he is who dreams of his own harm, Who dreaming wishes it may be a dream, So that he craves what is, as if it were not; Such I became, not having power to speak, For to excuse myself I wished, and still Excused myself, and did not think I did it. \"Less shame doth wash away a greater fault,\" The Master said, \"than this of thine has been; Therefore thyself disburden of all sadness, And make account that I am aye beside thee, If e'er it come to pass that fortune bring thee Where there are people in a like dispute; For a base wish it is to wish to hear it.\" 128",
      "modern": "Just as Juno's rage against the Theban bloodline\nburned for Semele's sake, as she had shown\nmore than once before,\nAthamas was stripped of all reason—\nseeing his wife walking with their two children,\none clinging to each hand,\nhe cried out: \"Spread the nets! I'll catch\nthe lioness and her cubs as they pass!\"\nThen he stretched out his merciless claws,\nseized the first child, named Learchus,\nwhirled him around and dashed him against a rock.\nThe mother, clutching her other burden, drowned herself.\n\nAnd when fortune cast down\nthe Trojans' pride that had dared everything,\ncrushing both king and kingdom,\nHecuba—sad, hopeless, captive—\nsaw lifeless Polyxena,\nthen discovered her son Polydorus\nwashed up on the ocean shore.\nDriven out of her mind, she barked like a dog,\nso completely had anguish twisted her soul.\n\nBut neither the Theban nor the Trojan furies\nwere ever seen to be so cruel\nin tormenting beasts, much less human beings,\nas I witnessed in two pale, naked shadows\nwho ran biting through that place\nlike wild boars released from their pen.\n\nOne rushed at Capocchio,\nsinking its teeth into his neck,\ndragging him so his belly scraped\nthe hard ground as they went.\n\nThe man from Arezzo, trembling,\nsaid to me: \"That mad demon is Gianni Schicchi—\nhe goes raging around, savaging others like this.\"\n\n\"Oh,\" I replied, \"if that other one\ndoesn't sink its teeth into you,\nplease don't let it tire you\nto tell us who it is before it darts away.\"\n\nHe answered: \"That's the ancient spirit\nof wicked Myrrha, who became\nher father's lover, beyond all natural love.\nShe came to sin with him\nby taking another woman's form—\njust as the one running there\ncounterfeited Buoso Donati himself\nto gain the lady of the inheritance,\ndrawing up a will in proper legal form.\"\n\nAfter those two maniacs passed\nand I had watched them go,\nI turned back to observe\nthe other misshapen souls.\n\nI saw one formed like a lute—\nif only he'd been cut off at the groin,\nright where the human body forks.\nHeavy dropsy had so swollen his limbs\nwith fluids his body couldn't process\nthat his face no longer matched his belly.\nIt forced him to hold his lips apart\nlike someone with fever—one toward his chin,\nthe other curled upward from thirst.\n\n\"You who suffer no torment\nin this world of woe—though I don't know why—\"\nhe said to us, \"look and pay attention\nto Master Adam's misery.\nIn life I had much of what I wanted,\nand now I crave a single drop of water.\n\nThe streams that flow from Casentino's green hills\ndown into the Arno,\nmaking their channels cool and wet,\nstand before me always—and not in vain,\nfor their image dries me up far more\nthan this disease that strips flesh from my face.\n\nThe rigid justice that punishes me\ndraws power from the very place I sinned,\nmaking my sighs fly faster.\nThere lies Romena, where I counterfeited\nthe currency stamped with the Baptist's image—\nfor which my body was burned above.\n\nBut if I could see the wretched soul\nof Guido, Alessandro, or their brother here,\nI wouldn't trade that sight for Branda's fountain.\nOne is already down here,\nif these raving shades circling around speak truth.\nBut what good does that do me, with limbs bound like this?\n\nIf I were light enough to move\njust one inch in a hundred years,\nI would have already started down the path\nsearching for him among this filthy crowd,\neven though this ring stretches eleven miles around\nand measures at least half a mile across.\nBecause of them I'm in such company—\nthey induced me to mint florins\nthat contained three carats of base metal.\"\n\nI asked him: \"Who are those two wretched souls\nthat steam like wet hands in winter,\nlying close beside your right border?\"\n\n\"I found them here when I rained down\ninto this pit,\" he replied, \"and they haven't moved since—\nnor do I think they ever will.\nOne is the lying woman who accused Joseph;\nthe other is false Sinon, the Greek from Troy.\nBurning fever makes them reek like that.\"\n\nOne of them, perhaps annoyed\nat being described so harshly,\nstruck his hardened belly with his fist.\nIt rang out like a drum,\nand Master Adam hit him in the face\nwith an arm that seemed no less solid,\nsaying: \"Though I can't move\nbecause my limbs are so heavy,\nI have one arm free for exactly this purpose.\"\n\nSinon shot back: \"When you went to the fire,\nthat arm wasn't so ready—\nthough it was ready enough when you were counterfeiting!\"\n\nThe dropsied one replied: \"You speak the truth there,\nbut you weren't such a truthful witness\nwhen they questioned you about Troy.\"\n\n\"If I spoke lies, you falsified coins,\"\nsaid Sinon, \"and I'm here for one crime,\nwhile you're here for more than any other demon.\"\n\n\"Remember the horse,

the putrid water\nthat makes your belly bulge before your eyes!\"\n\nThe counterfeiter then said: \"Your mouth\ngapes wide with evil speech as always—\nif I'm thirsty and swollen with fluid,\nyou burn with fever and your head pounds.\nYou wouldn't need many words of invitation\nto lick Narcissus's mirror.\"\n\nI was completely absorbed in listening to them\nwhen my master said: \"Keep staring like that\nand I'll be ready to quarrel with you!\"\n\nWhen I heard him speak to me in anger,\nI turned toward him with such shame\nthat it still churns through my memory.\nLike someone who dreams of disaster\nand while dreaming wishes it were only a dream,\nlonging for what is as if it weren't—\nthat's what I became, unable to speak,\nwanting to excuse myself\nyet excusing myself without realizing I was doing it.\n\n\"Less shame washes away a greater fault\nthan yours has been,\" my master said.\n\"So free yourself of all this sadness,\nand remember that I am always beside you\nif fate ever brings you again\nto where people are having such disputes.\nThe desire to hear such things is base.\"",

      "original": "One and the selfsame tongue first wounded me, So that it tinged the one cheek and the other, And then held out to me the medicine; Thus do I hear that once Achilles' spear, His and his father's, used to be the cause First of a sad and then a gracious boon. We turned our backs upon the wretched valley, Upon the bank that girds it round about, Going across it without any speech. There it was less than night, and less than day, So that my sight went little in advance; But I could hear the blare of a loud horn, So loud it would have made each thunder faint, Which, counter to it following its way, Mine eyes directed wholly to one place. After the dolorous discomfiture When Charlemagne the holy emprise lost, So terribly Orlando sounded not. Short while my head turned thitherward I held When many lofty towers I seemed to see, Whereat I: \"Master, say, what town is this?\" And he to me: \"Because thou peerest forth Athwart the darkness at too great a distance, It happens that thou errest in thy fancy. Well shalt thou see, if thou arrivest there, How much the sense deceives itself by distance; Therefore a little faster spur thee on.\" Then tenderly he took me by the hand, And said: \"Before we farther have advanced, 129 That the reality may seem to thee Less strange, know that these are not towers, but giants, And they are in the well, around the bank, From navel downward, one and all of them.\" As, when the fog is vanishing away, Little by little doth the sight refigure Whate'er the mist that crowds the air conceals, So, piercing through the dense and darksome air, More and more near approaching tow'rd the verge, My error fled, and fear came over me; Because as on its circular parapets Montereggione crowns itself with towers, E'en thus the margin which surrounds the well With one half of their bodies turreted The horrible giants, whom Jove menaces E'en now from out the heavens when he thunders. And I of one already saw the face, Shoulders, and breast, and great part of the belly, And down along his sides both of the arms. Certainly Nature, when she left the making Of animals like these, did well indeed, By taking such executors from Mars; And if of elephants and whales she doth not Repent her, whosoever looketh subtly More just and more discreet will hold her for it; For where the argument of intellect Is added unto evil will and power, No rampart can the people make against it. His face appeared to me as long and large As is at Rome the pine-cone of Saint Peter's, And in proportion were the other bones; So that the margin, which an apron was Down from the middle, showed so much of him Above it, that to reach up to his hair Three Frieslanders in vain had vaunted them; For I beheld thirty great palms of him Down from the place where man his mantle buckles. \"Raphael mai amech izabi almi,\" Began to clamour the ferocious mouth, To which were not befitting sweeter psalms. 130 \nAnd unto him my Guide: \"Soul idiotic, Keep to thy horn, and vent thyself with that, When wrath or other passion touches thee. Search round thy neck, and thou wilt find the belt Which keeps it fastened, O bewildered soul, And see it, where it bars thy mighty breast.\" Then said to me: \"He doth himself accuse; This one is Nimrod, by whose evil thought One language in the world is not still used. Here let us leave him and not speak in vain; For even such to him is every language As his to others, which to none is known.\" Therefore a longer journey did we make, Turned to the left, and a crossbow-shot oft We found another far more fierce and large. In binding him, who might the master be I cannot say; but he had pinioned close Behind the right arm, and in front the other, With chains, that held him so begirt about From the neck down, that on the part uncovered It wound itself as far as the fifth gyre. \"This proud one wished to make experiment Of his own power against the Supreme Jove,\" My Leader said, \"whence he has such a guerdon. Ephialtes is his name; he showed great prowess. What time the giants terrified the gods; The arms he wielded never more he moves.\" And I to him: \"If possible, I should wish That of the measureless Briareus These eyes of mine might have experience.\" Whence he replied: \"Thou shalt behold Antaeus Close by here, who can speak and is unbound, Who at the bottom of all crime shall place us. Much farther yon is he whom thou wouldst see, And he is bound, and fashioned like to this one, Save that he seems in aspect more ferocious.\" There never was an earthquake of such might That it could shake a tower so violently, As Ephialtes suddenly shook himself. Then was I more afraid of death than ever, 131 \nFor nothing more was needful than the fear, If I had not beheld the manacles. Then we proceeded farther in advance, And to Antaeus came, who, full five ells Without the head, forth issued from the cavern. \"O thou, who in the valley fortunate, Which Scipio the heir of glory made, When Hannibal turned back with all his hosts, Once brought'st a thousand lions for thy prey, And who, hadst thou been at the mighty war Among thy brothers, some it seems still think The sons of Earth the victory would have gained: Place us below, nor be disdainful of it, There where the cold doth lock Cocytus up. Make us not go to Tityus nor Typhoeus; This one can give of that which here is longed for; Therefore stoop down, and do not curl thy lip. Still in the world can he restore thy fame; Because he lives, and still expects long life, If to itself Grace call him not untimely.\" So said the Master; and in haste the other His hands extended and took up my Guide,— Hands whose great pressure Hercules once felt. Virgilius, when he felt himself embraced, Said unto me: \"Draw nigh, that I may take thee;\" Then of himself and me one bundle made. As seems the Carisenda, to behold Beneath the leaning side, when goes a cloud Above it so that opposite it hangs; Such did Antaeus seem to me, who stood Watching to see him stoop, and then it was I could have wished to go some other way. But lightly in the abyss, which swallows up Judas with Lucifer, he put us down; Nor thus bowed downward made he there delay, But, as a mast does in a ship, uprose. 132",
      "modern": "The same tongue that wounded me first,\nstaining both my cheeks with shame,\nthen offered its own cure—\njust as Achilles' spear, his father's before him,\nwas known to wound first, then heal.\n\nWe turned our backs on that wretched valley,\nclimbing the bank that circles it,\ncrossing without a word.\nThe light was neither night nor day,\nso I could barely see ahead,\nbut I heard the blast of a horn so loud\nit would have drowned out thunder itself.\nFollowing that tremendous sound,\nI turned my eyes toward its source.\n\nAfter that crushing defeat\nwhen Charlemagne lost his holy war,\nnot even Roland's horn rang out so terribly.\n\nI had barely turned my head\nwhen I seemed to see many tall towers rising,\nand I asked: \"Master, what city is this?\"\n\nHe answered: \"Because you're peering\nthrough darkness at too great a distance,\nyour imagination deceives you.\nWhen we get closer, you'll see\nhow distance tricks the senses—\nso quicken your pace a little.\"\n\nThen he took my hand gently and said:\n\"Before we go any further,\nto make this seem less strange,\nknow that these are not towers, but giants,\nstanding in the pit around the rim,\nburied from the navel down.\"\n\nLike fog gradually lifting\nto reveal what mist had hidden,\nas we pushed through the thick, dark air\nand drew closer to the edge,\nmy error fled and fear took hold—\nfor just as Montereggione crowns itself\nwith towers along its circular walls,\nso the horrible giants, whom Jove still threatens\nwith thunder from the heavens,\nrose like battlements around this well,\ntowering from the waist up.\n\nI could already make out one giant's face,\nshoulders, chest, and most of his belly,\nand both arms hanging at his sides.\nNature did well indeed\nwhen she stopped making creatures like these,\ntaking such weapons away from Mars.\nAnd while she doesn't regret\nmaking elephants and whales,\nanyone who looks carefully\nwill find her more just and wise for this—\nfor when sharp intelligence\njoins with evil will and power,\nno defense can protect humanity.\n\nHis face seemed as long and broad\nas the bronze pinecone at Saint Peter's in Rome,\nand his other features matched that scale.\nThe rim of the pit, like an apron\ncovering him from the waist down,\nstill left so much visible above\nthat three tall men standing on each other's shoulders\ncouldn't have reached his hair—\nI could see thirty handspans of him\nabove where a man would wear his belt.\n\n\"Raphel mai amech izabi almi!\"\nthe savage mouth began to bellow—\nno sweeter song would suit those lips.\n\nMy guide called back: \"Foolish soul!\nStick to your horn and blow off steam with that\nwhen rage or passion moves you.\nFeel around your neck—you'll find the strap\nthat holds it, confused spirit,\nand see how it crosses your enormous chest.\"\n\nThen he said to me: \"He condemns himself.\nThis is Nimrod, whose wicked plan\nleft the world without one common language.\nLet's leave him here and waste no more words—\nevery language sounds the same to him\nas his sounds to us, understood by none.\"\n\nWe made a longer journey then,\nturning left, and at a crossbow shot's distance\nfound another giant, far more fierce and large.\nWho could have been strong enough to bind him\nI cannot say, but he was chained\nwith his right arm pinioned behind his back,\nthe left in front, wrapped in chains\nfrom the neck down that coiled around him\nfive times on the part we could see.\n\n\"This proud one wanted to test\nhis strength against almighty Jove,\"\nmy leader said, \"and this is his reward.\nHis name is Ephialtes—he showed great might\nwhen the giants made the gods tremble.\nThe arms he brandished then will never move again.\"\n\nI said to him: \"If it were possible,\nI'd love to see the immeasurable Briareus\nwith my own eyes.\"\n\nHe replied: \"Nearby you'll see Antaeus,\nwho can speak and isn't chained.\nHe'll carry us down to the bottom of all sin.\nThe one you want to see is much farther on—\nhe's bound and shaped like this one,\nbut looks even more ferocious.\"\n\nNo earthquake ever shook a tower\nas violently as Ephialtes\nsuddenly shook himself.\nNever had I been more afraid of death—\nfear alone would have killed me\nif I hadn't seen those chains holding him.\n\nWe continued forward\nand came to Antaeus, who rose\na full twenty-five feet from the pit,\nnot counting his head.\n\n\"O you who in that blessed valley\nwhere Scipio won eternal glory\nwhen Hannibal retreated with his army,\nonce captured a thousand lions as prey—\nyou who, if you had fought\nin the great war alongside your brothers,\nsome still believe would have given\nthe sons of Earth victory:\ncarry us down without disdain\nto where the cold locks up Cocytus.\nDon't make us go to Tityos or Typhoeus—\nthis man can give you what you crave up there.\nSo bend down and don't sneer.\nHe can still restore your fame in the world,\nfor he lives and expects a long life,\nunless Grace calls him early.\"\n\nSo spoke my master, and quickly\nthe giant stretched out those hands\nthat once made Hercules feel their terrible grip,\nand lifted up my guide.\nWhen Virgil felt himself seized,\nhe said to me: \"Come close so I can hold you\"—\nand made us into a single bundle.\n\nLike the Garisenda tower appears\nwhen you stand beneath its leaning side\nand a cloud passes over it the opposite way,\nmaking it seem to fall toward you—\nthat's how Antaeus looked to me\nas I watched him bend down.\nI wished we could have taken another route.\n\nBut gently he lowered us into the abyss\nthat swallows Judas and Lucifer together.\nAnd having bent down to place us there,\nhe straightened up again,\nquick as a ship's mast rising.",

      "original": "If I had rhymes both rough and stridulous, As were appropriate to the dismal hole Down upon which thrust all the other rocks, I would press out the juice of my conception More fully; but because I have them not, Not without fear I bring myself to speak; For 'tis no enterprise to take in jest, To sketch the bottom of all the universe, Nor for a tongue that cries Mamma and Babbo. But may those Ladies help this verse of mine, Who helped Amphion in enclosing Thebes, That from the fact the word be not diverse. O rabble ill-begotten above all, Who're in the place to speak of which is hard, 'Twere better ye had here been sheep or goats! When we were down within the darksome well, Beneath the giant's feet, but lower far, And I was scanning still the lofty wall, I heard it said to me: \"Look how thou steppest! Take heed thou do not trample with thy feet The heads of the tired, miserable brothers!\" Whereat I turned me round, and saw before me And underfoot a lake, that from the frost The semblance had of glass, and not of water. So thick a veil ne'er made upon its current 133 In winter-time Danube in Austria, Nor there beneath the frigid sky the Don, As there was here; so that if Tambernich Had fallen upon it, or Pietrapana, E'en at the edge 'twould not have given a creak. And as to croak the frog doth place himself With muzzle out of water,—when is dreaming Of gleaning oftentimes the peasant-girl,— Livid, as far down as where shame appears, Were the disconsolate shades within the ice, Setting their teeth unto the note of storks. Each one his countenance held downward bent; From mouth the cold, from eyes the doleful heart Among them witness of itself procures. When round about me somewhat I had looked, I downward turned me, and saw two so close, The hair upon their heads together mingled. \"Ye who so strain your breasts together, tell me,\" I said, \"who are you;\" and they bent their necks, And when to me their faces they had lifted, Their eyes, which first were only moist within, Gushed o'er the eyelids, and the frost congealed The tears between, and locked them up again. Clamp never bound together wood with wood So strongly; whereat they, like two he-goats, Butted together, so much wrath o'ercame them. And one, who had by reason of the cold Lost both his ears, still with his visage downward, Said: \"Why dost thou so mirror thyself in us? If thou desire to know who these two are, The valley whence Bisenzio descends Belonged to them and to their father Albert. They from one body came, and all Caina Thou shalt search through, and shalt not find a shade More worthy to be fixed in gelatine; Not he in whom were broken breast and shadow At one and the same blow by Arthur's hand; Focaccia not; not he who me encumbers So with his head I see no farther forward, And bore the name of Sassol Mascheroni; 134 \nWell knowest thou who he was, if thou art Tuscan. And that thou put me not to further speech, Know that I Camicion de' Pazzi was, And wait Carlino to exonerate me.\" Then I beheld a thousand faces, made Purple with cold; whence o'er me comes a shudder, And evermore will come, at frozen ponds. And while we were advancing tow'rds the middle, Where everything of weight unites together, And I was shivering in the eternal shade, Whether 'twere will, or destiny, or chance, I know not; but in walking 'mong the heads I struck my foot hard in the face of one. Weeping he growled: \"Why dost thou trample me? Unless thou comest to increase the vengeance of Montaperti, why dost thou molest me?\" And I: \"My Master, now wait here for me, That I through him may issue from a doubt; Then thou mayst hurry me, as thou shalt wish.\" The Leader stopped; and to that one I said Who was blaspheming vehemently still: \"Who art thou, that thus reprehendest others?\" \"Now who art thou, that goest through Antenora Smiting,\" replied he, \"other people's cheeks, So that, if thou wert living, 'twere too much?\" \"Living I am, and dear to thee it may be,\" Was my response, \"if thou demandest fame, That 'mid the other notes thy name I place.\" And he to me: \"For the reverse I long; Take thyself hence, and give me no more trouble; For ill thou knowest to flatter in this hollow.\" Then by the scalp behind I seized upon him, And said: \"It must needs be thou name thyself, Or not a hair remain upon thee here.\" Whence he to me: \"Though thou strip off my hair, I will not tell thee who I am, nor show thee, If on my head a thousand times thou fall.\" I had his hair in hand already twisted, And more than one shock of it had pulled out, He barking, with his eyes held firmly down, 135 \nWhen cried another: \"What doth ail thee, Bocca? Is't not enough to clatter with thy jaws, But thou must bark? what devil touches thee?\" \"Now,\" said I, \"I care not to have thee speak, Accursed traitor; for unto thy shame I will report of thee veracious news.\" \"Begone,\" replied he, \"and tell what thou wilt, But be not silent, if thou issue hence, Of him who had just now his tongue so prompt; He weepeth here the silver of the French; 'I saw,' thus canst thou phrase it, 'him of Duera There where the sinners stand out in the cold.' If thou shouldst questioned be who else was there, Thou hast beside thee him of Beccaria, Of whom the gorget Florence slit asunder; Gianni del Soldanier, I think, may be Yonder with Ganellon, and Tebaldello Who oped Faenza when the people slep.\" Already we had gone away from him, When I beheld two frozen in one hole, So that one head a hood was to the other; And even as bread through hunger is devoured, The uppermost on the other set his teeth, There where the brain is to the nape united. Not in another fashion Tydeus gnawed The temples of Menalippus in disdain, Than that one did the skull and the other things. \"O thou, who showest by such bestial sign Thy hatred against him whom thou art eating, Tell me the wherefore,\" said I, \"with this compact, That if thou rightfully of him complain, In knowing who ye are, and his transgression, I in the world above repay thee for it, If that wherewith I speak be not dried up.\" 136",

      "original": "from his grim repast, That sinner, wiping it upon the hair Of the same head that he behind had wasted. Then he began: \"Thou wilt that I renew The desperate grief, which wrings my heart already To think of only, ere I speak of it; But if my words be seed that may bear fruit Of infamy to the traitor whom I gnaw, Speaking and weeping shalt thou see together. I know not who thou art, nor by what mode Thou hast come down here; but a Florentine Thou seemest to me truly, when I hear thee. Thou hast to know I was Count Ugolino, And this one was Ruggieri the Archbishop; Now I will tell thee why I am such a neighbour. That, by effect of his malicious thoughts, Trusting in him I was made prisoner, And after put to death, I need not say; But ne'ertheless what thou canst not have heard, That is to say, how cruel was my death, Hear shalt thou, and shalt know if he has wronged me. A narrow perforation in the mew, Which bears because of me the title of Famine, And in which others still must be locked up, Had shown me through its opening many moons Already, when I dreamed the evil dream Which of the future rent for me the veil. 137 This one appeared to me as lord and master, Hunting the wolf and whelps upon the mountain For which the Pisans cannot Lucca see. With sleuth-hounds gaunt, and eager, and well trained, Gualandi with Sismondi and Lanfianchi He had sent out before him to the front. After brief course seemed unto me forespent The father and the sons, and with sharp tushes It seemed to me I saw their flanks ripped open. When I before the morrow was awake, Moaning amid their sleep I heard my sons Who with me were, and asking after bread. Cruel indeed art thou, if yet thou grieve not, Thinking of what my heart foreboded me, And weep'st thou not, what art thou wont to weep at? They were awake now, and the hour drew nigh At which our food used to be brought to us, And through his dream was each one apprehensive; And I heard locking up the under door Of the horrible tower; whereat without a word I gazed into the faces of my sons. I wept not, I within so turned to stone; They wept; and darling little Anselm mine Said: 'Thou dost gaze so, father, what doth ail thee?' Still not a tear I shed, nor answer made All of that day, nor yet the night thereafter, Until another sun rose on the world. As now a little glimmer made its way Into the dolorous prison, and I saw Upon four faces my own very aspect, Both of my hands in agony I bit; And, thinking that I did it from desire Of eating, on a sudden they uprose, And said they: 'Father, much less pain 'twill give us If thou do eat of us; thyself didst clothe us With this poor flesh, and do thou strip it off.' I calmed me then, not to make them more sad. That day we all were silent, and the next. Ah! obdurate earth, wherefore didst thou not open? When we had come unto the fourth day, Gaddo 138 \nThrew himself down outstretched before my feet, Saying, 'My father, why dost thou not help me?' And there he died; and, as thou seest me, I saw the three fall, one by one, between The fifth day and the sixth; whence I betook me, Already blind, to groping over each, And three days called them after they were dead; Then hunger did what sorrow could not do.\" When he had said this, with his eyes distorted, The wretched skull resumed he with his teeth, Which, as a dog's, upon the bone were strong. Ah! Pisa, thou opprobrium of the people Of the fair land there where the 'Si' doth sound, Since slow to punish thee thy neighbours are, Let the Capraia and Gorgona move, And make a hedge across the mouth of Arno That every person in thee it may drown! For if Count Ugolino had the fame Of having in thy castles thee betrayed, Thou shouldst not on such cross have put his sons. Guiltless of any crime, thou modern Thebes! Their youth made Uguccione and Brigata, And the other two my song doth name above! We passed still farther onward, where the ice Another people ruggedly enswathes, Not downward turned, but all of them reversed. Weeping itself there does not let them weep, And grief that finds a barrier in the eyes Turns itself inward to increase the anguish; Because the earliest tears a cluster form, And, in the manner of a crystal visor, Fill all the cup beneath the eyebrow full. And notwithstanding that, as in a callus, Because of cold all sensibility Its station had abandoned in my face, Still it appeared to me I felt some wind; Whence I: \"My Master, who sets this in motion? Is not below here every vapour quenched?\" Whence he to me: \"Full soon shalt thou be where Thine eye shall answer make to thee of this, 139 \nSeeing the cause which raineth down the blast.\" And one of the wretches of the frozen crust Cried out to us: \"O souls so merciless That the last post is given unto you, Lift from mine eyes the rigid veils, that I May vent the sorrow which impregns my heart A little, e'er the weeping recongeal.\" Whence I to him: \"If thou wouldst have me help thee Say who thou wast; and if I free thee not, May I go to the bottom of the ice.\" Then he replied: \"I am Friar Alberigo; He am I of the fruit of the bad garden, Who here a date am getting for my fig.\" \"O,\" said I to him, \"now art thou, too, dead?\" And he to me: \"How may my body fare Up in the world, no knowledge I possess. Such an advantage has this Ptolomaea, That oftentimes the soul descendeth here Sooner than Atropos in motion sets it. And, that thou mayest more willingly remove From off my countenance these glassy tears, Know that as soon as any soul betrays As I have done, his body by a demon Is taken from him, who thereafter rules it, Until his time has wholly been revolved. Itself down rushes into such a cistern; And still perchance above appears the body Of yonder shade, that winters here behind me. This thou shouldst know, if thou hast just come down; It is Ser Branca d' Oria, and many years Have passed away since he was thus locked up.\" \"I think,\" said I to him, \"thou dost deceive me; For Branca d' Oria is not dead as yet, And eats, and drinks, and sleeps, and puts on clothes.\" \"In moat above,\" said he, \"of Malebranche, There where is boiling the tenacious pitch, As yet had Michel Zanche not arrived, When this one left a devil in his stead In his own body and one near of kin, Who made together with him the betrayal. 140 \nBut hitherward stretch out thy hand forthwith, Open mine eyes;\"—and open them I did not, And to be rude to him was courtesy. Ah, Genoese! ye men at variance With every virtue, full of every vice Wherefore are ye not scattered from the world? For with the vilest spirit of Romagna I found of you one such, who for his deeds In soul already in Cocytus bathes, And still above in body seems alive! 141",
      "modern": "That sinner lifted his mouth from his grim feast,\nwiping it clean on the hair of the very head\nhe had been devouring from behind.\n\nThen he began: \"You want me to renew\nthis desperate grief that crushes my heart\njust to think of it, before I even speak.\nBut if my words can plant seeds\nthat will bear fruit of infamy\nfor this traitor I gnaw upon,\nyou'll see me speak and weep together.\n\nI don't know who you are, or how\nyou've come down to this place,\nbut you sound truly Florentine when you speak.\nKnow that I was Count Ugolino,\nand this is Archbishop Ruggieri.\nNow I'll tell you why I am his neighbor here.\n\nHow, through his malicious scheming,\nI trusted him and was made prisoner,\nthen put to death—this needs no telling.\nBut what you could not have heard,\nhow cruel my death was,\nyou shall hear, and know if he has wronged me.\n\nA narrow opening in that prison\nwhich bears my name—the Tower of Famine—\nand where others must still be locked away,\nhad already shown me many moons\nthrough its slit, when I dreamed the evil dream\nthat tore away the veil of the future.\n\nThis one appeared as lord and master,\nhunting the wolf and her cubs on the mountain\nthat blocks the Pisans' view of Lucca.\nWith hounds lean, eager, and well-trained—\nGualandi with Sismondi and Lanfranchi—\nhe had sent before him to the front.\n\nAfter a brief chase, the father and sons\nseemed to me exhausted, and I saw\nsharp fangs ripping open their flanks.\n\nWhen I awoke before dawn,\nI heard my sons, who were there with me,\nmoaning in their sleep and crying for bread.\nYou are cruel indeed if you don't grieve now,\nthinking what my heart foresaw—\nand if you don't weep at this, what moves you to tears?\n\nThey woke, and the hour approached\nwhen food was usually brought to us,\nand each was troubled by his dream.\nThen I heard them lock the door below\nof that horrible tower, and without a word\nI stared into my sons' faces.\n\nI did not weep—I had turned to stone within.\nThey wept, and my dear little Anselm said:\n'Father, you stare so—what's wrong?'\nStill I shed no tear and gave no answer\nall that day, nor the following night,\nuntil another sun rose on the world.\n\nWhen a thin ray of light\nentered that prison of sorrow, and I saw\nmy own expression reflected in four faces,\nI bit both my hands in anguish.\nAnd they, thinking I did it from hunger,\nsuddenly rose up and said:\n'Father, it would cause us much less pain\nif you ate of us instead—you clothed us\nwith this wretched flesh, now strip it away.'\n\nI calmed myself then, not to sadden them more.\nThat day and the next, we all stayed silent.\nCruel earth! Why didn't you open up?\n\nWhen the fourth day came, Gaddo\nthrew himself down at my feet,\nsaying, 'Father, why don't you help me?'\nAnd there he died.

      "original": "\"'Vexilla Regis prodeunt Inferni' Towards us; therefore look in front of thee,\" My Master said, \"if thou discernest him.\" As, when there breathes a heavy fog, or when Our hemisphere is darkening into night, Appears far off a mill the wind is turning, Methought that such a building then I saw; And, for the wind, I drew myself behind My Guide, because there was no other shelter. Now was I, and with fear in verse I put it, There where the shades were wholly covered up, And glimmered through like unto straws in glass. Some prone are lying, others stand erect, This with the head, and that one with the soles; Another, bow-like, face to feet inverts. When in advance so far we had proceeded, That it my Master pleased to show to me The creature who once had the beauteous semblance, He from before me moved and made me stop, Saying: \"Behold Dis, and behold the place Where thou with fortitude must arm thyself.\" How frozen I became and powerless then, Ask it not, Reader, for I write it not, Because all language would be insufficient. I did not die, and I alive remained not; Think for thyself now, hast thou aught of wit, What I became, being of both deprived. 142 The Emperor of the kingdom dolorous From his mid-breast forth issued from the ice; And better with a giant I compare Than do the giants with those arms of his; Consider now how great must be that whole, Which unto such a part conforms itself. Were he as fair once, as he now is foul, And lifted up his brow against his Maker, Well may proceed from him all tribulation. O, what a marvel it appeared to me, When I beheld three faces on his head! The one in front, and that vermilion was; Two were the others, that were joined with this Above the middle part of either shoulder, And they were joined together at the crest; And the right-hand one seemed 'twixt white and yellow; The left was such to look upon as those Who come from where the Nile falls valley-ward. Underneath each came forth two mighty wings, Such as befitting were so great a bird; Sails of the sea I never saw so large. No feathers had they, but as of a bat Their fashion was; and he was waving them, So that three winds proceeded forth therefrom. Thereby Cocytus wholly was congealed. With six eyes did he weep, and down three chins Trickled the tear-drops and the bloody drivel. At every mouth he with his teeth was crunching A sinner, in the manner of a brake, So that he three of them tormented thus. To him in front the biting was as naught Unto the clawing, for sometimes the spine Utterly stripped of all the skin remained. \"That soul up there which has the greatest pain,\" The Master said, \"is Judas Iscariot; With head inside, he plies his legs without. Of the two others, who head downward are, The one who hangs from the black jowl is Brutus; See how he writhes himself, and speaks no word. And the other, who so stalwart seems, is Cassius. 143 \nBut night is reascending, and 'tis time That we depart, for we have seen the whole.\" As seemed him good, I clasped him round the neck, And he the vantage seized of time and place, And when the wings were opened wide apart, He laid fast hold upon the shaggy sides; From fell to fell descended downward then Between the thick hair and the frozen crust. When we were come to where the thigh revolves Exactly on the thickness of the haunch, The Guide, with labour and with hard-drawn breath, Turned round his head where he had had his legs, And grappled to the hair, as one who mounts, So that to Hell I thought we were returning. \"Keep fast thy hold, for by such stairs as these,\" The Master said, panting as one fatigued, \"Must we perforce depart from so much evil.\" Then through the opening of a rock he issued, And down upon the margin seated me; Then tow'rds me he outstretched his wary step. I lifted up mine eyes and thought to see Lucifer in the same way I had left him; And I beheld him upward hold his legs. And if I then became disquieted, Let stolid people think who do not see What the point is beyond which I had passed. \"Rise up,\" the Master said, \"upon thy feet; The way is long, and difficult the road, And now the sun to middle-tierce returns.\" It was not any palace corridor There where we were, but dungeon natural, With floor uneven and unease of light. \"Ere from the abyss I tear myself away, My Master,\" said I when I had arisen, \"To draw me from an error speak a little; Where is the ice? and how is this one fixed Thus upside down? and how in such short time From eve to morn has the sun made his transit?\" And he to me: \"Thou still imaginest Thou art beyond the centre, where I grasped 144 \nThe hair of the fell worm, who mines the world. That side thou wast, so long as I descended; When round I turned me, thou didst pass the point To which things heavy draw from every side, And now beneath the hemisphere art come Opposite that which overhangs the vast Dry-land, and 'neath whose cope was put to death The Man who without sin was born and lived. Thou hast thy feet upon the little sphere Which makes the other face of the Judecca. Here it is morn when it is evening there; And he who with his hair a stairway made us Still fixed remaineth as he was before. Upon this side he fell down out of heaven; And all the land, that whilom here emerged, For fear of him made of the sea a veil, And came to our hemisphere; and peradventure To flee from him, what on this side appears Left the place vacant here, and back recoiled.\" A place there is below, from Beelzebub As far receding as the tomb extends, Which not by sight is known, but by the sound Of a small rivulet, that there descendeth Through chasm within the stone, which it has gnawed With course that winds about and slightly falls. The Guide and I into that hidden road Now entered, to return to the bright world; And without care of having any rest We mounted up, he first and I the second, Till I beheld through a round aperture Some of the beauteous things that Heaven doth bear; Thence we came forth to rebehold the stars. 145 \nPart 2 Purgatorio 146",
      "modern": "\"The banners of the King of Hell advance\ntoward us—so look ahead,\"\n\n\"Look there, ahead of you,\" my Master said, \"see if you can make him out.\"\n\nLike a windmill turning in the distance\nwhen heavy fog rolls in\nor when our half of the world grows dark with night—\nthat's how the structure looked to me.\nI pulled myself behind my Guide to shelter from the wind,\nfor there was nowhere else to hide.\n\nNow I was there—and I write this with fear trembling in my words—\nwhere the shades were completely encased,\nshowing through the ice like straws trapped in glass.\nSome lay flat, others stood upright,\nsome head up, some feet up,\nothers bent like bows, faces curved down to meet their feet.\n\nWhen we had walked far enough forward\nthat my Master was ready to show me\nthe creature who once possessed perfect beauty,\nhe stepped aside and made me stop,\nsaying: \"Look—Dis. And this is the place\nwhere you must arm yourself with courage.\"\n\nHow frozen and powerless I became then—\ndon't ask me, Reader, for I won't write it down.\nAll words would fail.\nI did not die, yet I was not alive.\nThink for yourself, if you have any wisdom,\nwhat I became, stripped of both life and death.\n\nThe Emperor of the sorrowful kingdom\nrose from the ice at mid-chest.\nI would compare better with a giant\nthan giants would compare with his arms alone.\nConsider how massive the whole must be\nthat matches such proportions.\n\nIf he was once as beautiful as he is now hideous,\nand still he raised his face against his Maker,\nthen truly all suffering flows from him.\n\nWhat a wonder it seemed to me\nwhen I saw three faces on his head!\nThe one in front was crimson red.\nTwo others joined it\nabove the middle of each shoulder,\nmeeting together at the crown.\nThe right face seemed somewhere between white and yellow.\nThe left was the color of those\nwho come from where the Nile descends through valleys.\n\nBeneath each face emerged two enormous wings,\nfitting for such a mighty bird—\nI never saw such massive sails upon the sea.\nThey had no feathers, but were fashioned\nlike a bat's wings, and he beat them\nso that three winds rushed forth.\nThis froze all of Cocytus solid.\n\nWith six eyes he wept, and down three chins\ntears and bloody foam trickled.\nIn each mouth he crushed a sinner with his teeth,\ngrinding like a mill,\ntormenting all three at once.\n\nFor the one in front, the biting was nothing\ncompared to the clawing—sometimes\nhis back was completely stripped of skin.\n\n\"That soul up there suffering the greatest pain,\"\nthe Master said, \"is Judas Iscariot.\nHis head inside, he kicks his legs without.\nOf the other two hanging head down,\nthe one from the black jaw is Brutus—\nsee how he writhes and speaks no word.\nThe other, who looks so strong, is Cassius.\n\nBut night is rising again, and it's time\nwe leave, for we have seen everything.\"\n\nWhen he thought it right, I wrapped my arms around his neck.\nHe watched for the perfect moment,\nand when the wings spread wide apart,\nhe grabbed hold of the shaggy flanks.\nFrom tuft to tuft he climbed downward\nbetween the matted hair and frozen crust.\n\nWhen we reached the point where the thigh turns\nexactly at the thickness of the hip,\nmy Guide, laboring with difficult breath,\nturned his head where his feet had been\nand grasped the hair like someone climbing up—\nso that I thought we were heading back to Hell.\n\n\"Hold tight,\" the Master said, panting like one exhausted,\n\"for by stairs like these\nwe must escape from so much evil.\"\n\nThen he emerged through a rock's opening\nand set me down upon the edge.\nHe stepped carefully toward me.\n\nI lifted my eyes, expecting to see\nLucifer the same way I had left him,\nbut I saw him holding his legs upward.\n\nIf I became confused then,\nlet dull people judge who cannot see\nwhat point it was that I had passed.\n\n\"Get up,\" the Master said, \"stand on your feet.\nThe way is long and the road difficult,\nand already the sun returns to mid-morning.\"\n\nWhere we stood was no palace hall\nbut a natural cavern\nwith uneven floor and little light.\n\n\"Before I tear myself from the abyss,\nmy Master,\" I said when I had risen,\n\"speak a little to clear up my confusion.\nWhere is the ice? And how is he fixed\nupside down like this? And how in such short time\nhas the sun traveled from evening to morning?\"\n\nAnd he answered: \"You still imagine\nyou're on the other side of the center, where I grasped\nthe hair of the evil worm who pierces the world.\nYou were on that side as long as I descended.\nWhen I turned around, you passed the point\ntoward which all heavy things are drawn,\nand now you've come beneath the hemisphere\nopposite the one that covers the great\ndry land, under whose summit was killed\nthe Man who was born and lived without sin.\n\nYour feet rest on the small sphere\nthat forms the other face of Judecca.\nHere it is morning when it's evening there.\nAnd he whose hair made us a ladder\nremains fixed just as he was before.\n\nOn this side he fell from heaven,\nand all the land that once emerged here\nmade itself a veil of sea in fear of him\nand came to our hemisphere. And perhaps\nto flee from him, the land that appears on this side\nleft this place empty and rushed back up.\"\n\nThere is a place below, as far from Beelzebub\nas the tomb extends,\nknown not by sight but by the sound\nof a small stream that descends there\nthrough a channel in the rock it has carved\nwith its winding, gently sloping course.\n\nMy Guide and I entered that hidden passage\nto return to the bright world.\nWithout pausing for any rest\nwe climbed up, he first and I second,\nuntil through a round opening I glimpsed\nsome of the beautiful things that Heaven holds.\nThen we emerged to see the stars again.",

But let dead Poesy here rise again, O holy Muses, since that I am yours, And here Calliope somewhat ascend, My song accompanying with that sound, Of which the miserable magpies felt The blow so great, that they despaired of pardon. Sweet colour of the oriental sapphire, That was upgathered in the cloudless aspect Of the pure air, as far as the first circle, Unto mine eyes did recommence delight Soon as I issued forth from the dead air, Which had with sadness filled mine eyes and breast. The beauteous planet, that to love incites, Was making all the orient to laugh, Veiling the Fishes that were in her escort. To the right hand I turned, and fixed my mind Upon the other pole, and saw four stars Ne'er seen before save by the primal people. Rejoicing in their flamelets seemed the heaven. O thou septentrional and widowed site, Because thou art deprived of seeing these! When from regarding them I had withdrawn, Turning a little to the other pole, 147 There where the Wain had disappeared already, I saw beside me an old man alone, Worthy of so much reverence in his look, That more owes not to father any son. A long beard and with white hair intermingled He wore, in semblance like unto the tresses, Of which a double list fell on his breast. The rays of the four consecrated stars Did so adorn his countenance with light, That him I saw as were the sun before him. \"Who are you? ye who, counter the blind river, Have fled away from the eternal prison?\" Moving those venerable plumes, he said: \"Who guided you? or who has been your lamp In issuing forth out of the night profound, That ever black makes the infernal valley? The laws of the abyss, are they thus broken? Or is there changed in heaven some council new, That being damned ye come unto my crags?\" Then did my Leader lay his grasp upon me, And with his words, and with his hands and signs, Reverent he made in me my knees and brow; Then answered him: \"I came not of myself; A Lady from Heaven descended, at whose prayers I aided this one with my company. But since it is thy will more be unfolded Of our condition, how it truly is, Mine cannot be that this should be denied thee. This one has never his last evening seen, But by his folly was so near to it That very little time was there to turn. As I have said, I unto him was sent To rescue him, and other way was none Than this to which I have myself betaken. I've shown him all the people of perdition, And now those spirits I intend to show Who purge themselves beneath thy guardianship. How I have brought him would be long to tell thee. Virtue descendeth from on high that aids me To lead him to behold thee and to hear thee. 148 \nNow may it please thee to vouchsafe his coming; He seeketh Liberty, which is so dear, As knoweth he who life for her refuses. Thou know'st it; since, for her, to thee not bitter Was death in Utica, where thou didst leave The vesture, that will shine so, the great day. By us the eternal edicts are not broken; Since this one lives, and Minos binds not me; But of that circle I, where are the chaste Eyes of thy Marcia, who in looks still prays thee, O holy breast, to hold her as thine own; For her love, then, incline thyself to us. Permit us through thy sevenfold realm to go; I will take back this grace from thee to her, If to be mentioned there below thou deignest.\" \"Marcia so pleasing was unto mine eyes While I was on the other side,\" then said he, \"That every grace she wished of me I granted; Now that she dwells beyond the evil river, She can no longer move me, by that law Which, when I issued forth from there, was made. But if a Lady of Heaven do move and rule thee, As thou dost say, no flattery is needful; Let it suffice thee that for her thou ask me. Go, then, and see thou gird this one about With a smooth rush, and that thou wash his face, So that thou cleanse away all stain therefrom, For 'twere not fitting that the eye o'ercast By any mist should go before the first Angel, who is of those of Paradise. This little island round about its base Below there, yonder, where the billow beats it, Doth rushes bear upon its washy ooze; No other plant that putteth forth the leaf, Or that doth indurate, can there have life, Because it yieldeth not unto the shocks. Thereafter be not this way your return; The sun, which now is rising, will direct you To take the mount by easier ascent.\" With this he vanished; and I raised me up 149 \nWithout a word, and wholly drew myself Unto my Guide, and turned mine eyes to him. And he began: \"Son, follow thou my steps; Let us turn back, for on this side declines The plain unto its lower boundaries.\" The dawn was vanquishing the matin hour Which fled before it, so that from afar I recognised the trembling of the sea. Along the solitary plain we went As one who unto the lost road returns, And till he finds it seems to go in vain. As soon as we were come to where the dew Fights with the sun, and, being in a part Where shadow falls, little evaporates, Both of his hands upon the grass outspread In gentle manner did my Master place; Whence I, who of his action was aware, Extended unto him my tearful cheeks; There did he make in me uncovered wholly That hue which Hell had covered up in me. Then came we down upon the desert shore Which never yet saw navigate its waters Any that afterward had known return. There he begirt me as the other pleased; O marvellous! for even as he culled The humble plant, such it sprang up again Suddenly there where he uprooted it. 150",

      "original": "Already had the sun the horizon reached Whose circle of meridian covers o'er Jerusalem with its most lofty point, And night that opposite to him revolves Was issuing forth from Ganges with the Scales That fall from out her hand when she exceedeth; So that the white and the vermilion cheeks Of beautiful Aurora, where I was, By too great age were changing into orange. We still were on the border of the sea, Like people who are thinking of their road, Who go in heart and with the body stay; And lo! as when, upon the approach of morning, Through the gross vapours Mars grows fiery red Down in the West upon the ocean floor, Appeared to me—may I again behold it!— A light along the sea so swiftly coming, Its motion by no flight of wing is equalled; From which when I a little had withdrawn Mine eyes, that I might question my Conductor, Again I saw it brighter grown and larger. Then on each side of it appeared to me I knew not what of white, and underneath it Little by little there came forth another. My Master yet had uttered not a word While the first whiteness into wings unfolded; But when he clearly recognised the pilot, He cried: \"Make haste, make haste to bow the knee! Behold the Angel of God! fold thou thy hands! Henceforward shalt thou see such officers! 151 See how he scorneth human arguments, So that nor oar he wants, nor other sail Than his own wings, between so distant shores. See how he holds them pointed up to heaven, Fanning the air with the eternal pinions, That do not moult themselves like mortal hair!\" Then as still nearer and more near us came The Bird Divine, more radiant he appeared, So that near by the eye could not endure him, But down I cast it; and he came to shore With a small vessel, very swift and light, So that the water swallowed naught thereof. Upon the stern stood the Celestial Pilot; Beatitude seemed written in his face, And more than a hundred spirits sat within. \"In exitu Israel de Aegypto!\" They chanted all together in one voice, With whatso in that psalm is after written. Then made he sign of holy rood upon them, Whereat all cast themselves upon the shore, And he departed swiftly as he came. The throng which still remained there unfamiliar Seemed with the place, all round about them gazing, As one who in new matters makes essay. On every side was darting forth the day. The sun, who had with his resplendent shafts From the mid-heaven chased forth the Capricorn, When the new people lifted up their faces Towards us, saying to us: \"If ye know, Show us the way to go unto the mountain.\" And answer made Virgilius: \"Ye believe Perchance that we have knowledge of this place, But we are strangers even as yourselves. Just now we came, a little while before you, Another way, which was so rough and steep, That mounting will henceforth seem sport to us.\" The souls who had, from seeing me draw breath, Become aware that I was still alive, Pallid in their astonishment became; And as to messenger who bears the olive 152 \nThe people throng to listen to the news, And no one shows himself afraid of crowding, So at the sight of me stood motionless Those fortunate spirits, all of them, as if Oblivious to go and make them fair. One from among them saw I coming forward, As to embrace me, with such great affection, That it incited me to do the like. O empty shadows, save in aspect only! Three times behind it did I clasp my hands, As oft returned with them to my own breast! I think with wonder I depicted me; Whereat the shadow smiled and backward drew; And I, pursuing it, pressed farther forward. Gently it said that I should stay my steps; Then knew I who it was, and I entreated That it would stop awhile to speak with me. It made reply to me: \"Even as I loved thee In mortal body, so I love thee free; Therefore I stop; but wherefore goest thou?\" \"My own Casella! to return once more There where I am, I make this journey,\" said I; \"But how from thee has so much time be taken?\" And he to me: \"No outrage has been done me, If he who takes both when and whom he pleases Has many times denied to me this passage, For of a righteous will his own is made. He, sooth to say, for three months past has taken Whoever wished to enter with all peace; Whence I, who now had turned unto that shore Where salt the waters of the Tiber grow, Benignantly by him have been received. Unto that outlet now his wing is pointed, Because for evermore assemble there Those who tow'rds Acheron do not descend.\" And I: \"If some new law take not from thee Memory or practice of the song of love, Which used to quiet in me all my longings, Thee may it please to comfort therewithal Somewhat this soul of mine, that with its body 153 \nHitherward coming is so much distressed.\" \"Love, that within my mind discourses with me,\" Forthwith began he so melodiously, The melody within me still is sounding. My Master, and myself, and all that people Which with him were, appeared as satisfied As if naught else might touch the mind of any. We all of us were moveless and attentive Unto his notes; and lo! the grave old man, Exclaiming: \"What is this, ye laggard spirits? What negligence, what standing still is this? Run to the mountain to strip off the slough, That lets not God be manifest to you.\" Even as when, collecting grain or tares, The doves, together at their pasture met, Quiet, nor showing their accustomed pride, If aught appear of which they are afraid, Upon a sudden leave their food alone, Because they are assailed by greater care; So that fresh company did I behold The song relinquish, and go tow'rds the hill, As one who goes, and knows not whitherward; Nor was our own departure less in haste. 154",

After his feet had laid aside the haste Which mars the dignity of every act, My mind, that hitherto had been restrained, Let loose its faculties as if delighted, And I my sight directed to the hill That highest tow'rds the heaven uplifts itself. The sun, that in our rear was flaming red, Was broken in front of me into the figure Which had in me the stoppage of its rays; Unto one side I turned me, with the fear Of being left alone, when I beheld Only in front of me the ground obscured. \"Why dost thou still mistrust?\" my Comforter Began to say to me turned wholly round; \"Dost thou not think me with thee, and that I guide thee?

'Twixt Lerici and Turbia, the most desert, The most secluded pathway is a stair Easy and open, if compared with that. \"Who knoweth now upon which hand the hill Slopes down,\" my Master said, his footsteps staying, \"So that who goeth without wings may mount?\" And while he held his eyes upon the ground Examining the nature of the path, And I was looking up around the rock, On the left hand appeared to me a throng Of souls, that moved their feet in our direction, And did not seem to move, they came so slowly. \"Lift up thine eyes,\" I to the Master said; \"Behold, on this side, who will give us counsel, If thou of thine own self can have it not.\" Then he looked at me, and with frank expression Replied: \"Let us go there, for they come slowly, And thou be steadfast in thy hope, sweet son.\" Still was that people as far off from us, After a thousand steps of ours I say, 156 \nAs a good thrower with his hand would reach, When they all crowded unto the hard masses Of the high bank, and motionless stood and close, As he stands still to look who goes in doubt. \"O happy dead! O spirits elect already!\" Virgilius made beginning, \"by that peace Which I believe is waiting for you all, Tell us upon what side the mountain slopes, So that the going up be possible, For to lose time irks him most who most knows.\" As sheep come issuing forth from out the fold By ones and twos and threes, and the others stand Timidly, holding down their eyes and nostrils, And what the foremost does the others do, Huddling themselves against her, if she stop, Simple and quiet and the wherefore know not; So moving to approach us thereupon I saw the leader of that fortunate flock, Modest in face and dignified in gait. As soon as those in the advance saw broken The light upon the ground at my right side, So that from me the shadow reached the rock, They stopped, and backward drew themselves somewhat; And all the others, who came after them, Not knowing why nor wherefore, did the same. \"Without your asking, I confess to you This is a human body which you see, Whereby the sunshine on the ground is cleft. Marvel ye not thereat, but be persuaded That not without a power which comes from Heaven Doth he endeavour to surmount this wall.\" The Master thus; and said those worthy people: \"Return ye then, and enter in before us,\" Making a signal with the back o' the hand And one of them began: \"Whoe'er thou art, Thus going turn thine eyes, consider well If e'er thou saw me in the other world.\" I turned me tow'rds him, and looked at him closely; Blond was he, beautiful, and of noble aspect, But one of his eyebrows had a blow divided. 157 \nWhen with humility I had disclaimed E'er having seen him, \"Now behold!\" he said, And showed me high upon his breast a wound. Then said he with a smile: \"I am Manfredi, The grandson of the Empress Costanza; Therefore, when thou returnest, I beseech thee Go to my daughter beautiful, the mother Of Sicily's honour and of Aragon's, And the truth tell her, if aught else be told. After I had my body lacerated By these two mortal stabs, I gave myself Weeping to Him, who willingly doth pardon. Horrible my iniquities had been; But Infinite Goodness hath such ample arms, That it receives whatever turns to it. Had but Cosenza's pastor, who in chase Of me was sent by Clement at that time, In God read understandingly this page, The bones of my dead body still would be At the bridge-head, near unto Benevento, Under the safeguard of the heavy cairn. Now the rain bathes and moveth them the wind, Beyond the realm, almost beside the Verde, Where he transported them with tapers quenched. By malison of theirs is not so lost Eternal Love, that it cannot return, So long as hope has anything of green. True is it, who in contumacy dies Of Holy Church, though penitent at last, Must wait upon the outside this bank Thirty times told the time that he has been In his presumption, unless such decree Shorter by means of righteous prayers become. See now if thou hast power to make me happy, By making known unto my good Costanza How thou hast seen me, and this ban beside, For those on earth can much advance us here.\" 158",

      "original": "Whenever by delight or else by pain, That seizes any faculty of ours, Wholly to that the soul collects itself, It seemeth that no other power it heeds; And this against that error is which thinks One soul above another kindles in us. And hence, whenever aught is heard or seen Which keeps the soul intently bent upon it, Time passes on, and we perceive it not, Because one faculty is that which listens, And other that which the soul keeps entire; This is as if in bonds, and that is free. Of this I had experience positive In hearing and in gazing at that spirit; For fifty full degrees uprisen was The sun, and I had not perceived it, when We came to where those souls with one accord Cried out unto us: \"Here is what you ask.\" A greater opening ofttimes hedges up With but a little forkful of his thorns The villager, what time the grape imbrowns, Than was the passage-way through which ascended Only my Leader and myself behind him, After that company departed from us. One climbs Sanleo and descends in Noli, And mounts the summit of Bismantova, With feet alone; but here one needs must fly; With the swift pinions and the plumes I say 159 Of great desire, conducted after him Who gave me hope, and made a light for me. We mounted upward through the rifted rock, And on each side the border pressed upon us, And feet and hands the ground beneath required. When we were come upon the upper rim Of the high bank, out on the open slope, \"My Master,\" said I, \"what way shall we take?\" And he to me: \"No step of thine descend; Still up the mount behind me win thy way, Till some sage escort shall appear to us.\" The summit was so high it vanquished sight, And the hillside precipitous far more Than line from middle quadrant to the centre. Spent with fatigue was I, when I began: \"O my sweet Father! turn thee and behold How I remain alone, unless thou stay!\" \"O son,\" he said, \"up yonder drag thyself,\" Pointing me to a terrace somewhat higher, Which on that side encircles all the hill. These words of his so spurred me on, that I Strained every nerve, behind him scrambling up, Until the circle was beneath my feet. Thereon ourselves we seated both of us Turned to the East, from which we had ascended, For all men are delighted to look back. To the low shores mine eyes I first directed, Then to the sun uplifted them, and wondered That on the left hand we were smitten by it. The Poet well perceived that I was wholly Bewildered at the chariot of the light, Where 'twixt us and the Aquilon it entered. Whereon he said to me: \"If Castor and Pollux Were in the company of yonder mirror, That up and down conducteth with its light, Thou wouldst behold the zodiac's jagged wheel Revolving still more near unto the Bears, Unless it swerved aside from its old track. How that may be wouldst thou have power to think, Collected in thyself, imagine Zion 160 \nTogether with this mount on earth to stand, So that they both one sole horizon have, And hemispheres diverse; whereby the road Which Phaeton, alas! knew not to drive, Thou'lt see how of necessity must pass This on one side, when that upon the other, If thine intelligence right clearly heed.\" \"Truly, my Master,\" said I, \"never yet Saw I so clearly as I now discern, There where my wit appeared incompetent, That the mid-circle of supernal motion, Which in some art is the Equator called, And aye remains between the Sun and Winter, For reason which thou sayest, departeth hence Tow'rds the Septentrion, what time the Hebrews Beheld it tow'rds the region of the heat. But, if it pleaseth thee, I fain would learn How far we have to go; for the hill rises Higher than eyes of mine have power to rise.\" And he to me: \"This mount is such, that ever At the beginning down below 'tis tiresome, And aye the more one climbs, the less it hurts. Therefore, when it shall seem so pleasant to thee, That going up shall be to thee as easy As going down the current in a boat, Then at this pathway's ending thou wilt be; There to repose thy panting breath expect; No more I answer; and this I know for true.\" And as he finished uttering these words, A voice close by us sounded: \"Peradventure Thou wilt have need of sitting down ere that.\" At sound thereof each one of us turned round, And saw upon the left hand a great rock, Which neither I nor he before had noticed. Thither we drew; and there were persons there Who in the shadow stood behind the rock, As one through indolence is wont to stand. And one of them, who seemed to me fatigued, Was sitting down, and both his knees embraced, Holding his face low down between them bowed. 161 \n\"O my sweet Lord,\" I said, \"do turn thine eye On him who shows himself more negligent Then even Sloth herself his sister were.\" Then he turned round to us, and he gave heed, Just lifting up his eyes above his thigh, And said: \"Now go thou up, for thou art valiant.\" Then knew I who he was; and the distress, That still a little did my breathing quicken, My going to him hindered not; and after I came to him he hardly raised his head, Saying: \"Hast thou seen clearly how the sun O'er thy left shoulder drives his chariot?\" His sluggish attitude and his curt words A little unto laughter moved my lips; Then I began: \"Belacqua, I grieve not For thee henceforth; but tell me, wherefore seated In this place art thou? Waitest thou an escort? Or has thy usual habit seized upon thee?\" And he: \"O brother, what's the use of climbing? Since to my torment would not let me go The Angel of God, who sitteth at the gate. First heaven must needs so long revolve me round Outside thereof, as in my life it did, Since the good sighs I to the end postponed, Unless, e'er that, some prayer may bring me aid Which rises from a heart that lives in grace; What profit others that in heaven are heard not?\" Meanwhile the Poet was before me mounting, And saying: \"Come now; see the sun has touched Meridian, and from the shore the night Covers already with her foot Morocco.\" 162",

What matters it to thee what here is whispered? Come after me, and let the people talk; Stand like a steadfast tower, that never wags Its top for all the blowing of the winds; For evermore the man in whom is springing Thought upon thought, removes from him the mark, Because the force of one the other weakens.\" What could I say in answer but \"I come\"? I said it somewhat with that colour tinged Which makes a man of pardon sometimes worthy. Meanwhile along the mountain-side across Came people in advance of us a little, Singing the Miserere verse by verse. When they became aware I gave no place For passage of the sunshine through my body, They changed their song into a long, hoarse \"Oh!\" And two of them, in form of messengers, Ran forth to meet us, and demanded of us, 163 \"Of your condition make us cognisant.\" And said my Master: \"Ye can go your way And carry back again to those who sent you, That this one's body is of very flesh. If they stood still because they saw his shadow, As I suppose, enough is answered them; Him let them honour, it may profit them.\" Vapours enkindled saw I ne'er so swiftly At early nightfall cleave the air serene, Nor, at the set of sun, the clouds of August, But upward they returned in briefer time, And, on arriving, with the others wheeled Tow'rds us, like troops that run without a rein. \"This folk that presses unto us is great, And cometh to implore thee,\" said the Poet; \"So still go onward, and in going listen.\" \"O soul that goest to beatitude With the same members wherewith thou wast born,\" Shouting they came, \"a little stay thy steps, Look, if thou e'er hast any of us seen, So that o'er yonder thou bear news of him; Ah, why dost thou go on? Ah, why not stay? Long since we all were slain by violence, And sinners even to the latest hour; Then did a light from heaven admonish us, So that, both penitent and pardoning, forth From life we issued reconciled to God, Who with desire to see Him stirs our hearts.\" And I: \"Although I gaze into your faces, No one I recognize; but if may please you Aught I have power to do, ye well-born spirits, Speak ye, and I will do it, by that peace Which, following the feet of such a Guide, From world to world makes itself sought by me.\" And one began: \"Each one has confidence In thy good offices without an oath, Unless the I cannot cut off the I will; Whence I, who speak alone before the others, Pray thee, if ever thou dost see the land That 'twixt Romagna lies and that of Charles, 164 \nThou be so courteous to me of thy prayers In Fano, that they pray for me devoutly, That I may purge away my grave offences. From thence was I; but the deep wounds, through which Issued the blood wherein I had my seat, Were dealt me in bosom of the Antenori, There where I thought to be the most secure; 'Twas he of Este had it done, who held me In hatred far beyond what justice willed. But if towards the Mira I had fled, When I was overtaken at Oriaco, I still should be o'er yonder where men breathe. I ran to the lagoon, and reeds and mire Did so entangle me I fell, and saw there A lake made from my veins upon the ground.\" Then said another: \"Ah, be that desire Fulfilled that draws thee to the lofty mountain, As thou with pious pity aidest mine. I was of Montefeltro, and am Buonconte; Giovanna, nor none other cares for me; Hence among these I go with downcast front.\" And I to him: \"What violence or what chance Led thee astray so far from Campaldino, That never has thy sepulture been known?\" \"Oh,\" he replied, \"at Casentino's foot A river crosses named Archiano, born Above the Hermitage in Apennine. There where the name thereof becometh void Did I arrive, pierced through and through the throat, Fleeing on foot, and bloodying the plain; There my sight lost I, and my utterance Ceased in the name of Mary, and thereat I fell, and tenantless my flesh remained. Truth will I speak, repeat it to the living; God's Angel took me up, and he of hell Shouted: 'O thou from heaven, why dost thou rob me? Thou bearest away the eternal part of him, For one poor little tear, that takes him from me; But with the rest I'll deal in other fashion!' Well knowest thou how in the air is gathered 165 \nThat humid vapour which to water turns, Soon as it rises where the cold doth grasp it. He joined that evil will, which aye seeks evil, To intellect, and moved the mist and wind By means of power, which his own nature gave; Thereafter, when the day was spent, the valley From Pratomagno to the great yoke covered With fog, and made the heaven above intent, So that the pregnant air to water changed; Down fell the rain, and to the gullies came Whate'er of it earth tolerated not; And as it mingled with the mighty torrents, Towards the royal river with such speed It headlong rushed, that nothing held it back. My frozen body near unto its outlet The robust Archian found, and into Arno Thrust it, and loosened from my breast the cross I made of me, when agony o'ercame me; It rolled me on the banks and on the bottom, Then with its booty covered and begirt me.\" \"Ah, when thou hast returned unto the world, And rested thee from thy long journeying,\" After the second followed the third spirit, \"Do thou remember me who am the Pia; Siena made me, unmade me Maremma; He knoweth it, who had encircled first, Espousing me, my finger with his gem.\" 166",

Why do you rob me?\nYou carry away his eternal part\nfor one small tear that takes him from me,\nbut I'll deal with the rest differently!'\n\nYou know how humid vapor gathers in the air\nand turns to water as soon as it rises\nwhere the cold seizes it.\nHe joined that evil will, which always seeks evil,\nto intelligence, and stirred the mist and wind\nwith the power his nature gave him.\nWhen day was spent, he covered the valley\nfrom Pratomagno to the great ridge with fog,\nand made the sky above so dense\nthat the pregnant air changed to water.\nRain fell, and whatever the earth couldn't absorb\nflowed into the gullies.\nAs it merged with the mighty torrents,\nit rushed headlong toward the royal river\nwith such speed that nothing could stop it.\nThe swollen Archiano found my frozen body\nnear its mouth, swept it into the Arno,\nand loosened from my chest the cross\nI'd made with my arms when pain overcame me.\nIt rolled me along banks and bottom,\nthen covered and wrapped me with its debris.\"\n\nAfter this second spirit, a third followed:\n\"When you've returned to the world\nand rested from your long journey,\nremember me—I am Pia.\nSiena made me; the Maremma unmade me.\nHe knows this well, who first encircled\nmy finger with his jewel when he married me.\"",

      "original": "Whene'er is broken up the game of Zara, He who has lost remains behind despondent, The throws repeating, and in sadness learns; The people with the other all depart; One goes in front, and one behind doth pluck him, And at his side one brings himself to mind; He pauses not, and this and that one hears; They crowd no more to whom his hand he stretches, And from the throng he thus defends himself. Even such was I in that dense multitude, Turning to them this way and that my face, And, promising, I freed myself therefrom. There was the Aretine, who from the arms Untamed of Ghin di Tacco had his death, And he who fleeing from pursuit was drowned. There was imploring with his hands outstretched Frederick Novello, and that one of Pisa Who made the good Marzucco seem so strong. I saw Count Orso; and the soul divided By hatred and by envy from its body, As it declared, and not for crime committed, Pierre de la Brosse I say; and here provide While still on earth the Lady of Brabant, So that for this she be of no worse flock! As soon as I was free from all those shades Who only prayed that some one else may pray, So as to hasten their becoming holy, Began I: \"It appears that thou deniest, O light of mine, expressly in some text, 167 That orison can bend decree of Heaven; And ne'ertheless these people pray for this. Might then their expectation bootless be? Or is to me thy saying not quite clear?\" And he to me: \"My writing is explicit, And not fallacious is the hope of these, If with sane intellect 'tis well regarded; For top of judgment doth not vail itself, Because the fire of love fulfils at once What he must satisfy who here installs him. And there, where I affirmed that proposition, Defect was not amended by a prayer, Because the prayer from God was separate. Verily, in so deep a questioning Do not decide, unless she tell it thee, Who light 'twixt truth and intellect shall be. I know not if thou understand; I speak Of Beatrice; her shalt thou see above, Smiling and happy, on this mountain's top.\" And I: \"Good Leader, let us make more haste, For I no longer tire me as before; And see, e'en now the hill a shadow casts.\" \"We will go forward with this day\" he answered, \"As far as now is possible for us; But otherwise the fact is than thou thinkest. Ere thou art up there, thou shalt see return Him, who now hides himself behind the hill, So that thou dost not interrupt his rays. But yonder there behold! a soul that stationed All, all alone is looking hitherward; It will point out to us the quickest way.\" We came up unto it; O Lombard soul, How lofty and disdainful thou didst bear thee, And grand and slow in moving of thine eyes! Nothing whatever did it say to us, But let us go our way, eying us only After the manner of a couchant lion; Still near to it Virgilius drew, entreating That it would point us out the best ascent; And it replied not unto his demand, 168 \nBut of our native land and of our life It questioned us; and the sweet Guide began: \"Mantua,\"—and the shade, all in itself recluse, Rose tow'rds him from the place where first it was, Saying: \"O Mantuan, I am Sordello Of thine own land!\" and one embraced the other. Ah! servile Italy, grief's hostelry! A ship without a pilot in great tempest! No Lady thou of Provinces, but brothel! That noble soul was so impatient, only At the sweet sound of his own native land, To make its citizen glad welcome there; And now within thee are not without war Thy living ones, and one doth gnaw the other Of those whom one wall and one fosse shut in! Search, wretched one, all round about the shores Thy seaboard, and then look within thy bosom, If any part of thee enjoyeth peace! What boots it, that for thee Justinian The bridle mend, if empty be the saddle? Withouten this the shame would be the less. Ah! people, thou that oughtest to be devout, And to let Caesar sit upon the saddle, If well thou hearest what God teacheth thee, Behold how fell this wild beast has become, Being no longer by the spur corrected, Since thou hast laid thy hand upon the bridle. O German Albert! who abandonest Her that has grown recalcitrant and savage, And oughtest to bestride her saddle-bow, May a just judgment from the stars down fall Upon thy blood, and be it new and open, That thy successor may have fear thereof; Because thy father and thyself have suffered, By greed of those transalpine lands distrained, The garden of the empire to be waste. Come and behold Montecchi and Cappelletti, Monaldi and Fillippeschi, careless man! Those sad already, and these doubt-depressed! Come, cruel one! come and behold the oppression 169 \nOf thy nobility, and cure their wounds, And thou shalt see how safe is Santafiore! Come and behold thy Rome, that is lamenting, Widowed, alone, and day and night exclaims, \"My Caesar, why hast thou forsaken me?\" Come and behold how loving are the people; And if for us no pity moveth thee, Come and be made ashamed of thy renown! And if it lawful be, O Jove Supreme! Who upon earth for us wast crucified, Are thy just eyes averted otherwhere? Or preparation is 't, that, in the abyss Of thine own counsel, for some good thou makest From our perception utterly cut off? For all the towns of Italy are full Of tyrants, and becometh a Marcellus Each peasant churl who plays the partisan! My Florence! well mayst thou contented be With this digression, which concerns thee not, Thanks to thy people who such forethought take! Many at heart have justice, but shoot slowly, That unadvised they come not to the bow, But on their very lips thy people have it! Many refuse to bear the common burden; But thy solicitous people answereth Without being asked, and crieth: \"I submit.\" Now be thou joyful, for thou hast good reason; Thou affluent, thou in peace, thou full of wisdom! If I speak true, the event conceals it not. Athens and Lacedaemon, they who made The ancient laws, and were so civilized, Made towards living well a little sign Compared with thee, who makest such fine-spun Provisions, that to middle of November Reaches not what thou in October spinnest. How oft, within the time of thy remembrance, Laws, money, offices, and usages Hast thou remodelled, and renewed thy members? And if thou mind thee well, and see the light, Thou shalt behold thyself like a sick woman, 170 \nWho cannot find repose upon her down, But by her tossing wardeth off her pain. 171",

      "original": "After the gracious and glad salutations Had three and four times been reiterated, Sordello backward drew and said, \"Who are you?\" \"Or ever to this mountain were directed The souls deserving to ascend to God, My bones were buried by Octavian. I am Virgilius; and for no crime else Did I lose heaven, than for not having faith;\" In this wise then my Leader made reply. As one who suddenly before him sees Something whereat he marvels, who believes And yet does not, saying, \"It is! it is not!\" So he appeared; and then bowed down his brow, And with humility returned towards him, And, where inferiors embrace, embraced him. \"O glory of the Latians, thou,\" he said, \"Through whom our language showed what it could do O pride eternal of the place I came from, What merit or what grace to me reveals thee? If I to hear thy words be worthy, tell me If thou dost come from Hell, and from what cloister.\" \"Through all the circles of the doleful realm,\" Responded he, \"have I come hitherward; Heaven's power impelled me, and with that I come. I by not doing, not by doing, lost The sight of that high sun which thou desirest, And which too late by me was recognized. A place there is below not sad with torments, But darkness only, where the lamentations Have not the sound of wailing, but are sighs. 172 There dwell I with the little innocents Snatched by the teeth of Death, or ever they Were from our human sinfulness exempt. There dwell I among those who the three saintly Virtues did not put on, and without vice The others knew and followed all of them. But if thou know and can, some indication Give us by which we may the sooner come Where Purgatory has its right beginning.\" He answered: \"No fixed place has been assigned us; 'Tis lawful for me to go up and round; So far as I can go, as guide I join thee. But see already how the day declines, And to go up by night we are not able; Therefore 'tis well to think of some fair sojourn. Souls are there on the right hand here withdrawn; If thou permit me I will lead thee to them, And thou shalt know them not without delight.\" \"How is this?\" was the answer; \"should one wish To mount by night would he prevented be By others? or mayhap would not have power?\" And on the ground the good Sordello drew His finger, saying, \"See, this line alone Thou couldst not pass after the sun is gone; Not that aught else would hindrance give, however, To going up, save the nocturnal darkness; This with the want of power the will perplexes. We might indeed therewith return below, And, wandering, walk the hill-side round about, While the horizon holds the day imprisoned.\" Thereon my Lord, as if in wonder, said: \"Do thou conduct us thither, where thou sayest That we can take delight in tarrying.\" Little had we withdrawn us from that place, When I perceived the mount was hollowed out In fashion as the valleys here are hollowed. \"Thitherward,\" said that shade, \"will we repair, Where of itself the hill-side makes a lap, And there for the new day will we await.\" 'Twixt hill and plain there was a winding path 173 \nWhich led us to the margin of that dell, Where dies the border more than half away. Gold and fine silver, and scarlet and pearl-white, The Indian wood resplendent and serene, Fresh emerald the moment it is broken, By herbage and by flowers within that hollow Planted, each one in colour would be vanquished, As by its greater vanquished is the less. Nor in that place had nature painted only, But of the sweetness of a thousand odours Made there a mingled fragrance and unknown. \"Salve Regina,\" on the green and flowers There seated, singing, spirits I beheld, Which were not visible outside the valley. \"Before the scanty sun now seeks his nest,\" Began the Mantuan who had led us thither, \"Among them do not wish me to conduct you. Better from off this ledge the acts and faces Of all of them will you discriminate, Than in the plain below received among them. He who sits highest, and the semblance bears Of having what he should have done neglected, And to the others' song moves not his lips, Rudolph the Emperor was, who had the power To heal the wounds that Italy have slain, So that through others slowly she revives. The other, who in look doth comfort him, Governed the region where the water springs, The Moldau bears the Elbe, and Elbe the sea. His name was Ottocar; and in swaddling-clothes Far better he than bearded Winceslaus His son, who feeds in luxury and ease. And the small-nosed, who close in council seems With him that has an aspect so benign, Died fleeing and disflowering the lily; Look there, how he is beating at his breast! Behold the other one, who for his cheek Sighing has made of his own palm a bed; Father and father-in-law of France's Pest Are they, and know his vicious life and lewd, 174 \nAnd hence proceeds the grief that so doth pierce them. He who appears so stalwart, and chimes in, Singing, with that one of the manly nose, The cord of every valour wore begirt; And if as King had after him remained The stripling who in rear of him is sitting, Well had the valour passed from vase to vase, Which cannot of the other heirs be said. Frederick and Jacomo possess the realms, But none the better heritage possesses. Not oftentimes upriseth through the branches The probity of man; and this He wills Who gives it, so that we may ask of Him. Eke to the large-nosed reach my words, no less Than to the other, Pier, who with him sings; Whence Provence and Apulia grieve already The plant is as inferior to its seed, As more than Beatrice and Margaret Costanza boasteth of her husband still. Behold the monarch of the simple life, Harry of England, sitting there alone; He in his branches has a better issue. He who the lowest on the ground among them Sits looking upward, is the Marquis William, For whose sake Alessandria and her war Make Monferrat and Canavese weep.\" 175",
      "modern": "After the gracious and joyful greetings\nhad been exchanged three and four times over,\nSordello stepped back and asked, \"Who are you?\"\n\n\"Before souls worthy of ascending to God\nwere ever guided to this mountain,\nOctavian buried my bones.\nI am Virgil, and I lost heaven\nfor no other sin than for not having faith.\"\n\n\"not having faith.\" This was how my guide answered.\n\nLike someone who suddenly sees something that amazes him,\nwho believes and yet doesn't believe, saying \"It is! It isn't!\"—\nthat's how he appeared. Then he bowed his head\nand with humility returned to us,\nembracing him where inferiors embrace superiors.\n\n\"O glory of the Latins,\" he said,\n\"through whom our language showed what it could achieve,\nO eternal pride of the place I came from—\nwhat merit or what grace reveals you to me?\nIf I am worthy to hear your words, tell me:\ndo you come from Hell, and from what

without vice\nknew all the others and followed them completely.\n\nBut if you know and can tell us,\ngive us some sign by which we might sooner reach\nthe place where Purgatory truly begins.\"\n\nHe answered: \"No fixed place has been assigned to us.\nI'm allowed to go up and around;\nas far as I can go, I'll join you as guide.\nBut see how the day is already declining,\nand we cannot climb at night.\nSo we should think of finding some pleasant resting place.\nThere are souls withdrawn on the right side here—\nif you'll let me, I'll lead you to them,\nand you'll know them with delight.\"\n\n\"How can this be?\" came the answer.\n\"If someone wished to climb at night,\nwould he be prevented by others,\nor would he simply lack the power?\"\n\nAnd the good Sordello drew his finger\non the ground, saying: \"See, you could not pass\neven this line once the sun has set.\nNot that anything else would hinder\nthe ascent except the darkness of night—\nthis perplexes the will with powerlessness.\nWe could indeed go back down\nand wander around the hillside\nwhile the horizon holds the day imprisoned.\"\n\nThen my lord, as if amazed, said:\n\"Lead us to the place you speak of,\nwhere we can take pleasure in staying.\"\n\nWe had barely moved from that spot\nwhen I noticed the mountain was hollowed out\nthe way valleys are carved here.\n\"Over there,\" said that shade, \"we'll go\nwhere the hillside naturally forms a hollow,\nand there we'll wait for the new day.\"\n\nBetween hill and plain ran a winding path\nthat led us to the edge of that dell\nwhere the border fades more than halfway.\nGold and fine silver, scarlet and pearl-white,\nbrilliant and serene Indian wood,\nfresh emerald the moment it's split—\nall would be conquered in color\nby the grass and flowers planted in that valley,\nas the lesser is conquered by the greater.\n\nAnd nature had not only painted there\nbut from the sweetness of a thousand scents\ncreated a single unknown fragrance.\n\n\"Salve Regina\"—I saw spirits there\nseated on the green grass and flowers, singing,\nwho had not been visible outside the valley.\n\n\"Before the weakening sun seeks its nest,\"\nbegan the Mantuan who had led us there,\n\"don't ask me to take you down among them.\nFrom this ledge you'll better make out\nthe faces and actions of them all\nthan if you were received among them on the plain below.\n\nHe who sits highest and looks like someone\nwho neglected what he should have done,\nwho doesn't move his lips to the others' song—\nthat was Emperor Rudolf, who had the power\nto heal the wounds that have killed Italy,\nso that now she revives slowly through others.\n\nThe other one, who seems to comfort him,\nruled the land where the waters rise\nthat the Moldau carries to the Elbe, and the Elbe to the sea.\nHis name was Ottocar, and in swaddling clothes\nhe was far better than his bearded son Wenceslaus,\nwho feeds on luxury and idleness.\n\nAnd that small-nosed one, who appears in close council\nwith him of such kindly aspect,\ndied fleeing and deflowering the lily.\nLook there—see how he beats his breast!\nSee the other one, who has made a bed\nof his own palm for his cheek, sighing.\nThey are father and father-in-law to France's plague,\nand they know his vicious and dissolute life—\nfrom this comes the grief that pierces them so.\n\nHe who looks so robust and joins his voice,\nsinging with that one with the manly nose,\nwore the belt of every virtue.\nAnd if the young man sitting behind him\nhad remained king after him,\nthe virtue would have passed from vessel to vessel—\nwhich cannot be said of the other heirs.\nJames and Frederick possess the kingdoms,\nbut neither possesses the better inheritance.\n\nRarely does human worth rise through the branches—\nand He wills this, who gives it,\nso that we may ask it of Him.\nMy words reach the large-nosed one no less\nthan the other, Peter, who sings with him,\nfor which Provence and Apulia already grieve.\nThe plant is as inferior to its seed\nas Constance still boasts of her husband\nmore than Beatrice and Margaret can.\n\nSee the king of the simple life,\nHenry of England, sitting

It joined and lifted upward both its palms, Fixing its eyes upon the orient, As if it said to God, \"Naught else I care for.\" \"Te lucis ante\" so devoutly issued Forth from its mouth, and with such dulcet notes, It made me issue forth from my own mind. And then the others, sweetly and devoutly, Accompanied it through all the hymn entire, Having their eyes on the supernal wheels. Here, Reader, fix thine eyes well on the truth, For now indeed so subtile is the veil, Surely to penetrate within is easy. I saw that army of the gentle-born Thereafterward in silence upward gaze, As if in expectation, pale and humble; And from on high come forth and down descend, I saw two Angels with two flaming swords, Truncated and deprived of their points. Green as the little leaflets just now born Their garments were, which, by their verdant pinions 176 Beaten and blown abroad, they trailed behind. One just above us came to take his station, And one descended to the opposite bank, So that the people were contained between them. Clearly in them discerned I the blond head; But in their faces was the eye bewildered, As faculty confounded by excess. \"From Mary's bosom both of them have come,\" Sordello said, \"as guardians of the valley Against the serpent, that will come anon.\" Whereupon I, who knew not by what road, Turned round about, and closely drew myself, Utterly frozen, to the faithful shoulders. And once again Sordello: \"Now descend we 'Mid the grand shades, and we will speak to them; Right pleasant will it be for them to see you.\" Only three steps I think that I descended, And was below, and saw one who was looking Only at me, as if he fain would know me. Already now the air was growing dark, But not so that between his eyes and mine It did not show what it before locked up. Tow'rds me he moved, and I tow'rds him did move; Noble Judge Nino! how it me delighted, When I beheld thee not among the damned! No greeting fair was left unsaid between us; Then asked he: \"How long is it since thou camest O'er the far waters to the mountain's foot?\" \"Oh!\" said I to him, \"through the dismal places I came this morn; and am in the first life, Albeit the other, going thus, I gain.\" And on the instant my reply was heard, He and Sordello both shrank back from me, Like people who are suddenly bewildered. One to Virgilius, and the other turned To one who sat there, crying, \"Up, Currado! Come and behold what God in grace has willed!\" Then, turned to me: \"By that especial grace Thou owest unto Him, who so conceals His own first wherefore, that it has no ford, 177 \nWhen thou shalt be beyond the waters wide, Tell my Giovanna that she pray for me, Where answer to the innocent is made. I do not think her mother loves me more, Since she has laid aside her wimple white, Which she, unhappy, needs must wish again. Through her full easily is comprehended How long in woman lasts the fire of love, If eye or touch do not relight it often. So fair a hatchment will not make for her The Viper marshalling the Milanese A-field, as would have made Gallura's Cock.\" In this wise spake he, with the stamp impressed Upon his aspect of that righteous zeal Which measurably burneth in the heart. My greedy eyes still wandered up to heaven, Still to that point where slowest are the stars, Even as a wheel the nearest to its axle. And my Conductor: \"Son, what dost thou gaze at Up there?\" And I to him: \"At those three torches With which this hither pole is all on fire.\" And he to me: \"The four resplendent stars Thou sawest this morning are down yonder low, And these have mounted up to where those were.\" As he was speaking, to himself Sordello Drew him, and said, \"Lo there our Adversary!\" And pointed with his finger to look thither. Upon the side on which the little valley No barrier hath, a serpent was; perchance The same which gave to Eve the bitter food. 'Twixt grass and flowers came on the evil streak, Turning at times its head about, and licking Its back like to a beast that smoothes itself. I did not see, and therefore cannot say How the celestial falcons 'gan to move, But well I saw that they were both in motion. Hearing the air cleft by their verdant wings, The serpent fled, and round the Angels wheeled, Up to their stations flying back alike. The shade that to the Judge had near approached 178 \nWhen he had called, throughout that whole assault Had not a moment loosed its gaze on me. \"So may the light that leadeth thee on high Find in thine own free-will as much of wax As needful is up to the highest azure,\" Began it, \"if some true intelligence Of Valdimagra or its neighbourhood Thou knowest, tell it me, who once was great there. Currado Malaspina was I called; I'm not the elder, but from him descended; To mine I bore the love which here refineth.\" \"O,\" said I unto him, \"through your domains I never passed, but where is there a dwelling Throughout all Europe, where they are not known? That fame, which doeth honour to your house, Proclaims its Signors and proclaims its land, So that he knows of them who ne'er was there. And, as I hope for heaven, I swear to you Your honoured family in naught abates The glory of the purse and of the sword. It is so privileged by use and nature, That though a guilty head misguide the world, Sole it goes right, and scorns the evil way.\" And he: \"Now go; for the sun shall not lie Seven times upon the pillow which the Ram With all his four feet covers and bestrides, Before that such a courteous opinion Shall in the middle of thy head be nailed With greater nails than of another's speech, Unless the course of justice standeth still.\" 179",
      "modern": "Now comes the hour that turns back longing\nin those who sail the seas, and softens hearts—\nthe day they've bid farewell to cherished friends.\n\nThe hour when a new pilgrim's soul fills with love\nif he hears from far off a bell\nthat seems to mourn the dying day.\n\nIn that moment I began to silence my listening,\nwatching instead one of the souls\nwho had risen, lifting his hand for attention.\n\nHe joined both palms and raised them skyward,\nfixing his gaze upon the east,\nas if to say to God: \"Nothing else matters to me.\"\n\n\"Te lucis ante\" flowed so devoutly\nfrom his mouth, with notes so sweet,\nit lifted me completely from myself.\n\nAnd then the others, gently and reverently,\naccompanied him through the entire hymn,\ntheir eyes turned toward the celestial spheres.\n\nHere, reader, sharpen your focus on the truth—\nthe veil has grown so thin now\nthat seeing through it should be easy.\n\nI watched that noble company\ngaze upward afterward in silence,\npale and humble, as if waiting.\n\nAnd from on high I saw two Angels\ndescend with flaming swords,\ntheir blades broken off at the points.\n\nGreen as newborn leaves\nwere their robes, which streamed behind them,\nbeaten and spread wide by verdant wings.\n\nOne took position just above us,\nthe other landed on the opposite shore,\nso the people were contained between them.\n\nI could clearly see their golden hair,\nbut their faces dazzled my eyes—\nvision overwhelmed by excess of light.\n\n\"Both have come from Mary's lap,\" said Sordello,\n\"to guard this valley\nagainst the serpent that will soon appear.\"\n\nNot knowing which way to turn,\nI spun around and pressed myself,\nutterly chilled, against my guide's faithful shoulders.\n\nSordello spoke again: \"Let's go down now\namong these great shades and speak with them.\nThey'll be delighted to see you.\"\n\nI think I descended only three steps\nbefore I was below, and saw someone\nstaring at me as if trying to recognize me.\n\nThe air was growing dark by then,\nbut not so much that between his eyes and mine\nit couldn't reveal what it had hidden before.\n\nHe moved toward me, and I toward him.\nNoble Judge Nino! How it thrilled me\nto find you not among the damned!\n\nWe exchanged every proper greeting,\nthen he asked: \"How long has it been\nsince you came across distant waters to the mountain's base?\"\n\n\"This morning,\" I told him, \"I came through those terrible places.\nI'm still in my first life,\nthough by this journey I'm earning the other.\"\n\nThe instant they heard my answer,\nboth he and Sordello pulled back from me\nlike people suddenly bewildered.\n\nOne turned to Virgil, the other\nto someone sitting nearby, calling: \"Get up, Currado!\nCome see what God has graciously willed!\"\n\nThen, turning back to me: \"By that special grace\nyou owe to Him who hides His first purpose\nso deeply that no one can fathom it—\n\nwhen you're beyond the wide waters again,\ntell my Giovanna to pray for me\nwhere prayers of the innocent are answered.\n\nI don't think her mother loves me anymore,\nnot since she put aside her white widow's veil—\nwhich she, poor woman, will surely regret.\n\nThrough her it's easy to understand\nhow briefly love's fire burns in women\nunless eye or touch rekindle it often.\n\nThe viper that leads Milan's armies\nwon't give her as fine a tomb\nas Gallura's rooster would have made.\"\n\nHe spoke this way, his face marked\nby that righteous passion\nthat burns in measured flame within the heart.\n\nMy eager eyes kept wandering toward heaven,\ntoward that point where the stars move slowest,\nlike the part of a wheel nearest its axle.\n\nMy guide asked: \"Son, what are you staring at\nup there?\" And I replied: \"Those three torches\nthat set this pole ablaze with fire.\"\n\nHe answered: \"The four bright stars\nyou saw this morning are down low now,\nand these have risen to where those were.\"\n\nWhile he was speaking, Sordello\npulled him aside and said: \"Look there—our enemy!\"\npointing with his finger.\n\nOn the side where the little valley\nhas no barrier, a serpent approached—\nperhaps the same that gave Eve bitter fruit.\n\nThrough grass and flowers the evil creature came,\nturning its head from time to time,\nlicking its back like a grooming beast.\n\nI didn't see—and so can't tell you—\nhow the heavenly falcons began to move,\nbut I clearly saw both were in motion.\n\nHearing the air split by their green wings,\nthe serpent fled, and the angels wheeled around,\nflying back to their stations in unison.\n\nThe shade who had approached the judge\nwhen he called out, through all that assault\nnever took his gaze from me.\n\n\"May the light that leads you upward\nfind in your will as much receptiveness\nas you need to reach the highest heaven,\"\n\nhe began. \"If you know any true news\nof Valdimagra or its region,\ntell me—I was once great there.\n\nI was called Currado Malaspina.\nNot the elder, but descended from him.\nI bore my family that love which here grows pure.\"\n\n\"Through your domains,\" I said to him,\n\"I've never traveled, but where in all Europe\ndo people not know of them?\n\nThe fame that honors your house\nproclaims both lords and lands so widely\nthat even those who've never been there know them.\n\nAnd I swear to you, as I hope for heaven,\nyour honored family has never lost\nthe glory of generosity and sword.\n\nCustom and nature so privilege your line\nthat even though a corrupt leader misleads the world,\nyou alone stay straight and scorn the crooked path.\"\n\n\"Now go,\" he said, \"for the sun won't rest\nseven times on the bed the Ram\ncovers and straddles with all four feet\n\nbefore this gracious opinion of yours\nwill be nailed into your mind's center\nwith stronger nails than others' mere words—\nunless justice's course stands still.\"",

      "original": "now Gleamed white upon the eastern balcony, Forth from the arms of her sweet paramour; With gems her forehead all relucent was, Set in the shape of that cold animal Which with its tail doth smite amain the nations, And of the steps, with which she mounts, the Night Had taken two in that place where we were, And now the third was bending down its wings; When I, who something had of Adam in me, Vanquished by sleep, upon the grass reclined, There were all five of us already sat. Just at the hour when her sad lay begins The little swallow, near unto the morning, Perchance in memory of her former woes, And when the mind of man, a wanderer More from the flesh, and less by thought imprisoned, Almost prophetic in its visions is, In dreams it seemed to me I saw suspended An eagle in the sky, with plumes of gold, With wings wide open, and intent to stoop, And this, it seemed to me, was where had been By Ganymede his kith and kin abandoned, When to the high consistory he was rapt. I thought within myself, perchance he strikes From habit only here, and from elsewhere Disdains to bear up any in his feet. Then wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me, Terrible as the lightning he descended, 180 And snatched me upward even to the fire. Therein it seemed that he and I were burning, And the imagined fire did scorch me so, That of necessity my sleep was broken. Not otherwise Achilles started up, Around him turning his awakened eyes, And knowing not the place in which he was, What time from Chiron stealthily his mother Carried him sleeping in her arms to Scyros, Wherefrom the Greeks withdrew him afterwards, Than I upstarted, when from off my face Sleep fled away; and pallid I became, As doth the man who freezes with affright. Only my Comforter was at my side, And now the sun was more than two hours high, And turned towards the sea-shore was my face. \"Be not intimidated,\" said my Lord, \"Be reassured, for all is well with us; Do not restrain, but put forth all thy strength. Thou hast at length arrived at Purgatory; See there the cliff that closes it around; See there the entrance, where it seems disjoined. Whilom at dawn, which doth precede the day, When inwardly thy spirit was asleep Upon the flowers that deck the land below, There came a Lady and said: 'I am Lucia; Let me take this one up, who is asleep; So will I make his journey easier for him.' Sordello and the other noble shapes Remained; she took thee, and, as day grew bright, Upward she came, and I upon her footsteps. She laid thee here; and first her beauteous eyes That open entrance pointed out to me; Then she and sleep together went away.\" In guise of one whose doubts are reassured, And who to confidence his fear doth change, After the truth has been discovered to him, So did I change; and when without disquiet My Leader saw me, up along the cliff He moved, and I behind him, tow'rd the height. 181 \nReader, thou seest well how I exalt My theme, and therefore if with greater art I fortify it, marvel not thereat. Nearer approached we, and were in such place, That there, where first appeared to me a rift Like to a crevice that disparts a wall, I saw a portal, and three stairs beneath, Diverse in colour, to go up to it, And a gate-keeper, who yet spake no word. And as I opened more and more mine eyes, I saw him seated on the highest stair, Such in the face that I endured it not. And in his hand he had a naked sword, Which so reflected back the sunbeams tow'rds us, That oft in vain I lifted up mine eyes. \"Tell it from where you are, what is't you wish?\" Began he to exclaim; \"where is the escort? Take heed your coming hither harm you not!\" \"A Lady of Heaven, with these things conversant,\" My Master answered him, \"but even now Said to us, 'Thither go; there is the portal.'\" \"And may she speed your footsteps in all good,\" Again began the courteous janitor; \"Come forward then unto these stairs of ours.\" Thither did we approach; and the first stair Was marble white, so polished and so smooth, I mirrored myself therein as I appear. The second, tinct of deeper hue than perse, Was of a calcined and uneven stone, Cracked all asunder lengthwise and across. The third, that uppermost rests massively, Porphyry seemed to me, as flaming red As blood that from a vein is spirting forth. Both of his feet was holding upon this The Angel of God, upon the threshold seated, Which seemed to me a stone of diamond. Along the three stairs upward with good will Did my Conductor draw me, saying: \"Ask Humbly that he the fastening may undo.\" Devoutly at the holy feet I cast me, 182 \nFor mercy's sake besought that he would open, But first upon my breast three times I smote. Seven P's upon my forehead he described With the sword's point, and, \"Take heed that thou wash These wounds, when thou shalt be within,\" he said. Ashes, or earth that dry is excavated, Of the same colour were with his attire, And from beneath it he drew forth two keys. One was of gold, and the other was of silver; First with the white, and after with the yellow, Plied he the door, so that I was content. \"Whenever faileth either of these keys So that it turn not rightly in the lock,\" He said to us, \"this entrance doth not open. More precious one is, but the other needs More art and intellect ere it unlock, For it is that which doth the knot unloose. From Peter I have them; and he bade me err Rather in opening than in keeping shut, If people but fall down before my feet.\" Then pushed the portals of the sacred door, Exclaiming: \"Enter; but I give you warning That forth returns whoever looks behind.\" And when upon their hinges were turned round The swivels of that consecrated gate, Which are of metal, massive and sonorous, Roared not so loud, nor so discordant seemed Tarpeia, when was ta'en from it the good Metellus, wherefore meagre it remained. At the first thunder-peal I turned attentive, And \"Te Deum laudamus\" seemed to hear In voices mingled with sweet melody. Exactly such an image rendered me That which I heard, as we are wont to catch, When people singing with the organ stand; For now we hear, and now hear not, the words. 183",
      "modern": "Dawn gleamed white on the eastern horizon,\nemerging from the arms of her sweet lover.\nHer forehead blazed with gems arranged\nin the shape of that cold constellation,\nthe Scorpion that strikes nations with its tail.\nNight had already climbed two of the steps\nby which she ascends, and now the third\nwas folding down its wings,\n\nwhen I, carrying something of Adam within me,\nconquered by sleep, stretched out upon the grass\nwhere all five of us had been sitting.\n\nJust at the hour when the little swallow\nbegins her mournful song near morning,\nperhaps remembering her ancient sorrows,\nand when the human mind, wandering\nfurther from flesh and less imprisoned by thought,\nbecomes almost prophetic in its visions—\n\nin dreams I seemed to see an eagle\nsuspended in the sky, with golden feathers,\nwings spread wide, poised to dive.\nThis was the place, it seemed to me,\nwhere Ganymede was abandoned by his people\nwhen he was swept up to the high assembly.\n\nI thought to myself: perhaps this eagle strikes\nonly here out of habit, and disdains elsewhere\nto carry anyone up in its talons.\nThen, wheeling somewhat more, it seemed to me\nterrible as lightning, it descended\nand snatched me upward even to the sphere of fire.\n\nThere it seemed that both he and I were burning,\nand the imagined flames scorched me so intensely\nthat my sleep shattered of necessity.\n\nNot otherwise did Achilles startle awake,\nturning his awakened eyes around him,\nnot knowing where he was,\nwhen his mother secretly carried him\nsleeping in her arms from Chiron to Scyros,\nfrom where the Greeks later retrieved him—\n\nso I started up when sleep fled from my face,\nand I grew pale as one who freezes with terror.\nOnly my Guide was at my side,\nthe sun was more than two hours high,\nand my face was turned toward the sea.\n\n\"Don't be afraid,\" my Lord said,\n\"Be confident, for all goes well with us.\nDon't hold back—put forth all your strength.\nYou have finally arrived at Purgatory.\nSee there the cliff that encircles it,\nsee there the entrance where it appears broken.\n\nEarlier, at dawn before the day,\nwhile your soul slept\nupon the flowers that adorn the valley below,\na Lady came and said: 'I am Lucia.\nLet me lift this sleeping one\nso I can ease his journey.'\n\nSordello and the other noble spirits remained behind.\nShe took you, and as day brightened,\nshe came upward, and I followed in her steps.\nShe laid you here, and first her beautiful eyes\nshowed me that open entrance,\nthen she and sleep departed together.\"\n\nLike one whose doubts are laid to rest,\nwho changes fear to confidence\nafter the truth has been revealed to him,\nso I was transformed.

      "original": "When we had crossed the threshold of the door Which the perverted love of souls disuses, Because it makes the crooked way seem straight, Re-echoing I heard it closed again; And if I had turned back mine eyes upon it, What for my failing had been fit excuse? We mounted upward through a rifted rock, Which undulated to this side and that, Even as a wave receding and advancing. \"Here it behoves us use a little art,\" Began my Leader, \"to adapt ourselves Now here, now there, to the receding side.\" And this our footsteps so infrequent made, That sooner had the moon's decreasing disk Regained its bed to sink again to rest, Than we were forth from out that needle's eye; But when we free and in the open were, There where the mountain backward piles itself, I wearied out, and both of us uncertain About our way, we stopped upon a plain More desolate than roads across the deserts. From where its margin borders on the void, To foot of the high bank that ever rises, A human body three times told would measure; And far as eye of mine could wing its flight, Now on the left, and on the right flank now, The same this cornice did appear to me. Thereon our feet had not been moved as yet, When I perceived the embankment round about, 184 Which all right of ascent had interdicted, To be of marble white, and so adorned With sculptures, that not only Polycletus, But Nature's self, had there been put to shame. The Angel, who came down to earth with tidings Of peace, that had been wept for many a year, And opened Heaven from its long interdict, In front of us appeared so truthfully There sculptured in a gracious attitude, He did not seem an image that is silent. One would have sworn that he was saying, \"Ave;\" For she was there in effigy portrayed Who turned the key to ope the exalted love, And in her mien this language had impressed, \"Ecce ancilla Dei,\" as distinctly As any figure stamps itself in wax. \"Keep not thy mind upon one place alone,\" The gentle Master said, who had me standing Upon that side where people have their hearts; Whereat I moved mine eyes, and I beheld In rear of Mary, and upon that side Where he was standing who conducted me, Another story on the rock imposed; Wherefore I passed Virgilius and drew near, So that before mine eyes it might be set. There sculptured in the self-same marble were The cart and oxen, drawing the holy ark, Wherefore one dreads an office not appointed. People appeared in front, and all of them In seven choirs divided, of two senses Made one say \"No,\" the other, \"Yes, they sing.\" Likewise unto the smoke of the frankincense, Which there was imaged forth, the eyes and nose Were in the yes and no discordant made. Preceded there the vessel benedight, Dancing with girded loins, the humble Psalmist, And more and less than King was he in this. Opposite, represented at the window Of a great palace, Michal looked upon him, Even as a woman scornful and afflicted. 185 \nI moved my feet from where I had been standing, To examine near at hand another story, Which after Michal glimmered white upon me. There the high glory of the Roman Prince Was chronicled, whose great beneficence Moved Gregory to his great victory; 'Tis of the Emperor Trajan I am speaking; And a poor widow at his bridle stood, In attitude of weeping and of grief. Around about him seemed it thronged and full Of cavaliers, and the eagles in the gold Above them visibly in the wind were moving. The wretched woman in the midst of these Seemed to be saying: \"Give me vengeance, Lord, For my dead son, for whom my heart is breaking.\" And he to answer her: \"Now wait until I shall return.\" And she: \"My Lord,\" like one In whom grief is impatient, \"shouldst thou not Return?\" And he: \"Who shall be where I am Will give it thee.\" And she: \"Good deed of others What boots it thee, if thou neglect thine own?\" Whence he: \"Now comfort thee, for it behoves me That I discharge my duty ere I move; Justice so wills, and pity doth retain me.\" He who on no new thing has ever looked Was the creator of this visible language, Novel to us, for here it is not found. While I delighted me in contemplating The images of such humility, And dear to look on for their Maker's sake, \"Behold, upon this side, but rare they make Their steps,\" the Poet murmured, \"many people; These will direct us to the lofty stairs.\" Mine eyes, that in beholding were intent To see new things, of which they curious are, In turning round towards him were not slow. But still I wish not, Reader, thou shouldst swerve From thy good purposes, because thou hearest How God ordaineth that the debt be paid; Attend not to the fashion of the torment, 186 \nThink of what follows; think that at the worst It cannot reach beyond the mighty sentence. \"Master,\" began I, \"that which I behold Moving towards us seems to me not persons, And what I know not, so in sight I waver.\" And he to me: \"The grievous quality Of this their torment bows them so to earth, That my own eyes at first contended with it; But look there fixedly, and disentangle By sight what cometh underneath those stones; Already canst thou see how each is stricken.\" O ye proud Christians! wretched, weary ones! Who, in the vision of the mind infirm Confidence have in your backsliding steps, Do ye not comprehend that we are worms, Born to bring forth the angelic butterfly That flieth unto judgment without screen? Why floats aloft your spirit high in air? Like are ye unto insects undeveloped, Even as the worm in whom formation fails! As to sustain a ceiling or a roof, In place of corbel, oftentimes a figure Is seen to join its knees unto its breast, Which makes of the unreal real anguish Arise in him who sees it, fashioned thus Beheld I those, when I had ta'en good heed. True is it, they were more or less bent down, According as they more or less were laden; And he who had most patience in his looks Weeping did seem to say, \"I can no more!\" 187",

Come unto us the peace of thy dominion, For unto it we cannot of ourselves, If it come not, with all our intellect. Even as thine own Angels of their will Make sacrifice to thee, Hosanna singing, So may all men make sacrifice of theirs. Give unto us this day our daily manna, Withouten which in this rough wilderness Backward goes he who toils most to advance. And even as we the trespass we have suffered Pardon in one another, pardon thou Benignly, and regard not our desert. Our virtue, which is easily o'ercome, Put not to proof with the old Adversary, But thou from him who spurs it so, deliver. This last petition verily, dear Lord, Not for ourselves is made, who need it not, But for their sake who have remained behind us.\" Thus for themselves and us good furtherance Those shades imploring, went beneath a weight Like unto that of which we sometimes dream, Unequally in anguish round and round And weary all, upon that foremost cornice, 188 Purging away the smoke-stains of the world. If there good words are always said for us, What may not here be said and done for them, By those who have a good root to their will? Well may we help them wash away the marks That hence they carried, so that clean and light They may ascend unto the starry wheels! \"Ah! so may pity and justice you disburden Soon, that ye may have power to move the wing, That shall uplift you after your desire, Show us on which hand tow'rd the stairs the way Is shortest, and if more than one the passes, Point us out that which least abruptly falls; For he who cometh with me, through the burden Of Adam's flesh wherewith he is invested, Against his will is chary of his climbing.\" The words of theirs which they returned to those That he whom I was following had spoken, It was not manifest from whom they came, But it was said: \"To the right hand come with us Along the bank, and ye shall find a pass Possible for living person to ascend. And were I not impeded by the stone, Which this proud neck of mine doth subjugate, Whence I am forced to hold my visage down, Him, who still lives and does not name himself, Would I regard, to see if I may know him And make him piteous unto this burden. A Latian was I, and born of a great Tuscan; Guglielmo Aldobrandeschi was my father; I know not if his name were ever with you. The ancient blood and deeds of gallantry Of my progenitors so arrogant made me That, thinking not upon the common mother, All men I held in scorn to such extent I died therefor, as know the Sienese, And every child in Campagnatico. I am Omberto; and not to me alone Has pride done harm, but all my kith and kin Has with it dragged into adversity. 189 \nAnd here must I this burden bear for it Till God be satisfied, since I did not Among the living, here among the dead.\" Listening I downward bent my countenance; And one of them, not this one who was speaking, Twisted himself beneath the weight that cramps him, And looked at me, and knew me, and called out, Keeping his eyes laboriously fixed On me, who all bowed down was going with them. \"O,\" asked I him, \"art thou not Oderisi, Agobbio's honour, and honour of that art Which is in Paris called illuminating?\" \"Brother,\" said he, \"more laughing are the leaves Touched by the brush of Franco Bolognese; All his the honour now, and mine in part. In sooth I had not been so courteous While I was living, for the great desire Of excellence, on which my heart was bent. Here of such pride is paid the forfeiture; And yet I should not be here, were it not That, having power to sin, I turned to God. O thou vain glory of the human powers, How little green upon thy summit lingers, If't be not followed by an age of grossness! In painting Cimabue thought that he Should hold the field, now Giotto has the cry, So that the other's fame is growing dim. So has one Guido from the other taken The glory of our tongue, and he perchance Is born, who from the nest shall chase them both. Naught is this mundane rumour but a breath Of wind, that comes now this way and now that, And changes name, because it changes side. What fame shalt thou have more, if old peel off From thee thy flesh, than if thou hadst been dead Before thou left the 'pappo' and the 'dindi,' Ere pass a thousand years? which is a shorter Space to the eterne, than twinkling of an eye Unto the circle that in heaven wheels slowest. With him, who takes so little of the road 190 \nIn front of me, all Tuscany resounded; And now he scarce is lisped of in Siena, Where he was lord, what time was overthrown The Florentine delirium, that superb Was at that day as now 'tis prostitute. Your reputation is the colour of grass Which comes and goes, and that discolours it By which it issues green from out the earth.\" And I: \"Thy true speech fills my heart with good Humility, and great tumour thou assuagest; But who is he, of whom just now thou spakest?\" \"That,\" he replied, \"is Provenzan Salvani, And he is here because he had presumed To bring Siena all into his hands. He has gone thus, and goeth without rest E'er since he died; such money renders back In payment he who is on earth too daring.\" And I: \"If every spirit who awaits The verge of life before that he repent, Remains below there and ascends not hither, (Unless good orison shall him bestead,) Until as much time as he lived be passed, How was the coming granted him in largess?\" \"When he in greatest splendour lived,\" said he, \"Freely upon the Campo of Siena, All shame being laid aside, he placed himself; And there to draw his friend from the duress Which in the prison-house of Charles he suffered, He brought himself to tremble in each vein. I say no more, and know that I speak darkly; Yet little time shall pass before thy neighbours Will so demean themselves that thou canst gloss it.

dreams,\nunequal in their anguish, circling round and round,\nweary, along that first terrace,\npurging away the smoke-stains of the world.\n\nIf good words are always spoken there for us,\nwhat might be said and done here for them\nby those whose will is rooted in goodness?\nWe may well help them wash away the marks\nthey carried from earth, so that clean and light\nthey may rise to the wheeling

satisfied,\nsince I failed to do so among the living—\nhere among the dead.\"\n\nI bent my face downward, listening.\nOne of them—not the one who had been speaking—\ntwisted beneath the weight that cramped him,\nsaw me and recognized me, and called out,\nkeeping his eyes fixed on me with effort\nas I walked bent over with them.\n\n\"Oh,\" I asked him, \"are you not Oderisi,\nGubbio's honor,

shed your flesh in old age\nthan if you had died before you stopped saying 'papa' and 'mama'—\nbefore a thousand years pass?\nThat span is shorter compared to eternity\nthan the blink of an eye\ncompared to the slowest-turning sphere in heaven.\n\nThe man who takes such small steps\nahead of me once made all Tuscany ring with his name,\nand now he is barely whispered of in Siena,\nwhere he was lord when Florence's mad rage\nwas overthrown—that pride which was as fierce then\nas it is corrupt today.\n\nYour reputation is like the color of grass:\nit comes and goes, and the same

I had moved on, and followed willingly The footsteps of my Master, and we both Already showed how light of foot we were, When unto me he said: \"Cast down thine eyes; 'Twere well for thee, to alleviate the way, To look upon the bed beneath thy feet.\" As, that some memory may exist of them, Above the buried dead their tombs in earth Bear sculptured on them what they were before; Whence often there we weep for them afresh, From pricking of remembrance, which alone To the compassionate doth set its spur; So saw I there, but of a better semblance In point of artifice, with figures covered Whate'er as pathway from the mount projects. I saw that one who was created noble More than all other creatures, down from heaven Flaming with lightnings fall upon one side. I saw Briareus smitten by the dart Celestial, lying on the other side, 192 Heavy upon the earth by mortal frost. I saw Thymbraeus, Pallas saw, and Mars, Still clad in armour round about their father, Gaze at the scattered members of the giants. I saw, at foot of his great labour, Nimrod, As if bewildered, looking at the people Who had been proud with him in Sennaar. O Niobe! with what afflicted eyes Thee I beheld upon the pathway traced, Between thy seven and seven children slain! O Saul! how fallen upon thy proper sword Didst thou appear there lifeless in Gilboa, That felt thereafter neither rain nor dew! O mad Arachne! so I thee beheld E'en then half spider, sad upon the shreds Of fabric wrought in evil hour for thee! O Rehoboam! no more seems to threaten Thine image there; but full of consternation A chariot bears it off, when none pursues! Displayed moreo'er the adamantine pavement How unto his own mother made Alcmaeon Costly appear the luckless ornament; Displayed how his own sons did throw themselves Upon Sennacherib within the temple, And how, he being dead, they left him there; Displayed the ruin and the cruel carnage That Tomyris wrought, when she to Cyrus said, \"Blood didst thou thirst for, and with blood I glut thee!\" Displayed how routed fled the Assyrians After that Holofernes had been slain, And likewise the remainder of that slaughter. I saw there Troy in ashes and in caverns; O Ilion! thee, how abject and debased, Displayed the image that is there discerned! Whoe'er of pencil master was or stile, That could portray the shades and traits which there Would cause each subtile genius to admire? Dead seemed the dead, the living seemed alive; Better than I saw not who saw the truth, All that I trod upon while bowed I went. 193 \nNow wax ye proud, and on with looks uplifted, Ye sons of Eve, and bow not down your faces So that ye may behold your evil ways! More of the mount by us was now encompassed, And far more spent the circuit of the sun, Than had the mind preoccupied imagined, When he, who ever watchful in advance Was going on, began: \"Lift up thy head, 'Tis no more time to go thus meditating. Lo there an Angel who is making haste To come towards us; lo, returning is From service of the day the sixth handmaiden. With reverence thine acts and looks adorn, So that he may delight to speed us upward; Think that this day will never dawn again.\" I was familiar with his admonition Ever to lose no time; so on this theme He could not unto me speak covertly. Towards us came the being beautiful Vested in white, and in his countenance Such as appears the tremulous morning star. His arms he opened, and opened then his wings; \"Come,\" said he, \"near at hand here are the steps, And easy from henceforth is the ascent.\" At this announcement few are they who come! O human creatures, born to soar aloft, Why fall ye thus before a little wind? He led us on to where the rock was cleft; There smote upon my forehead with his wings, Then a safe passage promised unto me. As on the right hand, to ascend the mount Where seated is the church that lordeth it O'er the well-guided, above Rubaconte, The bold abruptness of the ascent is broken By stairways that were made there in the age When still were safe the ledger and the stave, E'en thus attempered is the bank which falls Sheer downward from the second circle there; But on this, side and that the high rock graze. As we were turning thitherward our persons, 194 \n\"Beati pauperes spiritu,\" voices Sang in such wise that speech could tell it not. Ah me! how different are these entrances From the Infernal! for with anthems here One enters, and below with wild laments. We now were hunting up the sacred stairs, And it appeared to me by far more easy Than on the plain it had appeared before. Whence I: \"My Master, say, what heavy thing Has been uplifted from me, so that hardly Aught of fatigue is felt by me in walking?\" He answered: \"When the P's which have remained Still on thy face almost obliterate Shall wholly, as the first is, be erased, Thy feet will be so vanquished by good will, That not alone they shall not feel fatigue, But urging up will be to them delight.\" Then did I even as they do who are going With something on the head to them unknown, Unless the signs of others make them doubt, Wherefore the hand to ascertain is helpful, And seeks and finds, and doth fulfill the office Which cannot be accomplished by the sight; And with the fingers of the right hand spread I found but six the letters, that had carved Upon my temples he who bore the keys; Upon beholding which my Leader smiled. 195",

There in like manner doth a cornice bind The hill all round about, as does the first, Save that its arc more suddenly is curved. Shade is there none, nor sculpture that appears; So seems the bank, and so the road seems smooth, With but the livid colour of the stone. \"If to inquire we wait for people here,\" The Poet said, \"I fear that peradventure Too much delay will our election have.\" Then steadfast on the sun his eyes he fixed, Made his right side the centre of his motion, And turned the left part of himself about. \"O thou sweet light! with trust in whom I enter Upon this novel journey, do thou lead us,\" Said he, \"as one within here should be led. Thou warmest the world, thou shinest over it; If other reason prompt not otherwise, Thy rays should evermore our leaders be!\" As much as here is counted for a mile, So much already there had we advanced In little time, by dint of ready will; And tow'rds us there were heard to fly, albeit They were not visible, spirits uttering Unto Love's table courteous invitations, The first voice that passed onward in its flight, \"Vinum non habent,\" said in accents loud, And went reiterating it behind us. 196 And ere it wholly grew inaudible Because of distance, passed another, crying, \"I am Orestes!\" and it also stayed not. \"O,\" said I, \"Father, these, what voices are they?\" And even as I asked, behold the third, Saying: \"Love those from whom ye have had evil!\" And the good Master said: \"This circle scourges The sin of envy, and on that account Are drawn from love the lashes of the scourge. The bridle of another sound shall be; I think that thou wilt hear it, as I judge, Before thou comest to the Pass of Pardon. But fix thine eyes athwart the air right steadfast, And people thou wilt see before us sitting, And each one close against the cliff is seated.\" Then wider than at first mine eyes I opened; I looked before me, and saw shades with mantles Not from the colour of the stone diverse. And when we were a little farther onward, I heard a cry of, \"Mary, pray for us!\" A cry of, \"Michael, Peter, and all Saints!\" I do not think there walketh still on earth A man so hard, that he would not be pierced With pity at what afterward I saw. For when I had approached so near to them That manifest to me their acts became, Drained was I at the eyes by heavy grief. Covered with sackcloth vile they seemed to me, And one sustained the other with his shoulder, And all of them were by the bank sustained. Thus do the blind, in want of livelihood, Stand at the doors of churches asking alms, And one upon another leans his head, So that in others pity soon may rise, Not only at the accent of their words, But at their aspect, which no less implores. And as unto the blind the sun comes not, So to the shades, of whom just now I spake, Heaven's light will not be bounteous of itself; For all their lids an iron wire transpierces, 197 \nAnd sews them up, as to a sparhawk wild Is done, because it will not quiet stay. To me it seemed, in passing, to do outrage, Seeing the others without being seen; Wherefore I turned me to my counsel sage. Well knew he what the mute one wished to say, And therefore waited not for my demand, But said: \"Speak, and be brief, and to the point.\" I had Virgilius upon that side Of the embankment from which one may fall, Since by no border 'tis engarlanded; Upon the other side of me I had The shades devout, who through the horrible seam Pressed out the tears so that they bathed their cheeks. To them I turned me, and, \"O people, certain,\" Began I, \"of beholding the high light, Which your desire has solely in its care, So may grace speedily dissolve the scum Upon your consciences, that limpidly Through them descend the river of the mind, Tell me, for dear 'twill be to me and gracious, If any soul among you here is Latian, And 'twill perchance be good for him I learn it.\" \"O brother mine, each one is citizen Of one true city; but thy meaning is, Who may have lived in Italy a pilgrim.\" By way of answer this I seemed to hear A little farther on than where I stood, Whereat I made myself still nearer heard. Among the rest I saw a shade that waited In aspect, and should any one ask how, Its chin it lifted upward like a blind man. \"Spirit,\" I said, \"who stoopest to ascend, If thou art he who did reply to me, Make thyself known to me by place or name.\" \"Sienese was I,\" it replied, \"and with The others here recleanse my guilty life, Weeping to Him to lend himself to us. Sapient I was not, although I Sapia Was called, and I was at another's harm 198 \nMore happy far than at my own good fortune. And that thou mayst not think that I deceive thee, Hear if I was as foolish as I tell thee. The arc already of my years descending, My fellow-citizens near unto Colle Were joined in battle with their adversaries, And I was praying God for what he willed. Routed were they, and turned into the bitter Passes of flight; and I, the chase beholding, A joy received unequalled by all others; So that I lifted upward my bold face Crying to God, 'Henceforth I fear thee not,' As did the blackbird at the little sunshine. Peace I desired with God at the extreme Of my existence, and as yet would not My debt have been by penitence discharged, Had it not been that in remembrance held me Pier Pettignano in his holy prayers, Who out of charity was grieved for me. But who art thou, that into our conditions Questioning goest, and hast thine eyes unbound As I believe, and breathing dost discourse?\" \"Mine eyes,\" I said, \"will yet be here ta'en from me, But for short space; for small is the offence Committed by their being turned with envy. Far greater is the fear, wherein suspended My soul is, of the torment underneath, For even now the load down there weighs on me.\" And she to me: \"Who led thee, then, among us Up here, if to return below thou thinkest?\" And I: \"He who is with me, and speaks not; And living am I; therefore ask of me, Spirit elect, if thou wouldst have me move O'er yonder yet my mortal feet for thee.\" \"O, this is such a novel thing to hear,\" She answered, \"that great sign it is God loves thee; Therefore with prayer of thine sometimes assist me. And I implore, by what thou most desirest, If e'er thou treadest the soil of Tuscany, Well with my kindred reinstate my fame. 199 \nThem wilt thou see among that people vain Who hope in Talamone, and will lose there More hope than in discovering the Diana; But there still more the admirals will lose.\" 200",

I'd be happy to render it into modern, accessible English once I have the complete text to work with.\n\nAt the summit of the stairs,\nwhere the mountain is carved away a second time—\nthis mountain that purifies all who climb—\nanother terrace circles the steep slope\nlike the first, but with a sharper curve.\n\nNo shadows fall here, no carved reliefs appear.\nThe cliff face seems bare, the path smooth,\nonly the stone's gray color visible.\n\n\"If we wait here for people to question,\"\nthe Poet said, \"I fear we might\ndelay our journey too long.\"\n\nHe fixed his eyes steadily on the sun,\nmade his right side the pivot of his movement,\nand wheeled his left side around.\n\n\"O sweet light, in whom I trust\nas I enter this unknown path—lead us\nas we should be led within this place.\nYou warm the world, you shine upon it.\nUnless some other reason guides us,\nyour rays should always be our guides.\"\n\nIn little time, driven by eager will,\nwe had already traveled what would measure\na mile in the world above.\n\nToward us came the sound of spirits flying—\nthough we could not see them—\ncalling out gracious invitations to Love's feast.\n\nThe first voice that passed by in flight\ncried out loudly, \"They have no wine!\"\nand kept repeating this behind us.\n\nBefore it faded completely with distance,\nanother passed, crying \"I am Orestes!\"\nand this one also did not pause.\n\n\"Father,\" I said, \"what voices are these?\"\n\nAnd as I asked, a third appeared,\nsaying: \"Love those who have wronged you!\"\n\nThe good Master said: \"This circle punishes\nthe sin of envy, and for this reason\nthe whips of the scourge are drawn from love.\nThe bridle will sound different—\nI believe you will hear it, as I judge,\nbefore you reach the Gate of Forgiveness.\n\nBut look straight ahead through the air,\nand you will see people sitting before us,\neach one pressed close against the cliff.\"\n\nI opened my eyes wider than before,\nlooked ahead, and saw shades wearing cloaks\nno different in color from the stone.\n\nWhen we had moved a little farther,\nI heard cries of \"Mary, pray for us!\"\nand \"Michael and Peter and all Saints!\"\n\nI do not think any man still walks on earth\nso hardened that he would not be pierced\nwith pity at what I saw next.\n\nWhen I had come close enough\nthat their condition became clear to me,\nheavy grief drained from my eyes.\n\nThey seemed covered in coarse sackcloth,\neach one supported by another's shoulder,\nand all of them leaned against the bank.\n\nSo the blind, lacking sustenance,\nstand at the doors of churches begging alms,\none resting his head upon another\nso that pity may quickly rise in others—\nnot only from the sound of their words\nbut from their appearance, which pleads no less.\n\nAnd as the sun does not reach the blind,\nso Heaven's light would not give itself freely\nto these shades I now describe:\nan iron wire pierces all their eyelids\nand sews them shut, as is done\nto a wild hawk that will not stay still.\n\nIt seemed wrong to me, as I passed,\nto see others without being seen myself,\nso I turned to my wise counselor.\n\nHe knew well what the silent one wished to say\nand did not wait for my request,\nbut said: \"Speak, and be brief and to the point.\"\n\nI had Virgil on the side\nof the ledge from which one might fall,\nsince no parapet bordered it.\nOn my other side were the devout shades\nwho through their horrible stitching\npressed out tears that bathed their cheeks.\n\nI turned to them and began:\n\"O people, certain of beholding\nthe high light that alone fulfills your longing—\nmay grace soon dissolve the scum\nupon your consciences, so that clearly\nthe river of the mind may flow through them—\ntell me, for it will be dear and precious to me,\nif any soul among you is Italian,\nand perhaps it will be good for him that I learn this.\"\n\n\"O my brother, each of us is a citizen\nof one true city; but you mean to ask\nwho may have lived as a pilgrim in Italy.\"\n\nThis seemed to be the answer I heard\na little farther on than where I stood,\nso I moved closer to be heard.\n\nAmong the others I saw a shade that waited\nexpectantly—and if anyone asks how,\nit lifted its chin upward like a blind person.\n\n\"Spirit,\" I said, \"who bends low to ascend,\nif you are the one who answered me,\nmake yourself known by place or name.\"\n\n\"I was from Siena,\" it replied, \"and with\nthese others here I cleanse my guilty life,\nweeping to Him to grant himself to us.\n\nI was not wise, though I was called\nSapia, and I rejoiced far more\nin others' harm than in my own good fortune.\n\nSo that you may not think I deceive you,\nhear whether I was as foolish as I tell you.\nWhen the arc of my years was already descending,\nmy fellow citizens joined in battle\nnear Colle against their enemies,\nand I prayed to God for what he willed.\n\nThey were routed and turned to the bitter\npasses of flight, and I, watching the chase,\nfelt joy unlike any other.\nI lifted my bold face upward,\ncrying to God, 'Now I fear you no more!'—\nlike the blackbird does at a little sunshine.\n\nI desired peace with God only at the end\nof my life, and my debt still would not\nhave been discharged by penance,\nhad it not been for Pier Pettignano,\nwho held me in his holy prayers\nand grieved for me out of charity.\n\nBut who are you, who question\nour condition and have your eyes unbound,\nas I believe, and speak while breathing?\"\n\n\"My eyes,\" I said, \"will yet be taken from me\nhere, but only briefly, for small is the offense\nthey committed by turning with envy.\nMuch greater is the fear that holds\nmy soul suspended—of the torment below,\nfor even now that weight presses on me.\"\n\nAnd she said to me: \"Who then led you\nup here among us, if you think to return below?\"\n\nAnd I: \"He who is with me and does not speak.\nI am alive; therefore ask of me,\nchosen spirit, if you would have me\nmove my mortal feet for you over there.\"\n\n\"Oh, this is such a strange thing to hear,\"\nshe answered, \"that it is a great sign God loves you.\nTherefore sometimes help me with your prayers.\nAnd I beg you, by what you most desire,\nif you ever walk on Tuscan soil,\nrestore my good name among my family.\n\nYou will see them among those vain people\nwho place their hope in Talamone—they will lose\nmore hope there than in finding the Diana.\nBut the admirals will lose even more.\"",

      "original": "one that goes about our mountain, Or ever Death has given him power of flight, And opes his eyes and shuts them at his will?\" \"I know not who, but know he's not alone; Ask him thyself, for thou art nearer to him, And gently, so that he may speak, accost him.\" Thus did two spirits, leaning tow'rds each other, Discourse about me there on the right hand; Then held supine their faces to address me. And said the one: \"O soul, that, fastened still Within the body, tow'rds the heaven art going, For charity console us, and declare Whence comest and who art thou; for thou mak'st us As much to marvel at this grace of thine As must a thing that never yet has been.\" And I: \"Through midst of Tuscany there wanders A streamlet that is born in Falterona, And not a hundred miles of course suffice it; From thereupon do I this body bring. To tell you who I am were speech in vain, Because my name as yet makes no great noise.\" \"If well thy meaning I can penetrate With intellect of mine,\" then answered me He who first spake, \"thou speakest of the Arno.\" And said the other to him: \"Why concealed This one the appellation of that river, Even as a man doth of things horrible?\" And thus the shade that questioned was of this Himself acquitted: \"I know not; but truly 201 'Tis fit the name of such a valley perish; For from its fountain-head (where is so pregnant The Alpine mountain whence is cleft Peloro That in few places it that mark surpasses) To where it yields itself in restoration Of what the heaven doth of the sea dry up, Whence have the rivers that which goes with them, Virtue is like an enemy avoided By all, as is a serpent, through misfortune Of place, or through bad habit that impels them; On which account have so transformed their nature The dwellers in that miserable valley, It seems that Circe had them in her pasture. 'Mid ugly swine, of acorns worthier Than other food for human use created, It first directeth its impoverished way. Curs findeth it thereafter, coming downward, More snarling than their puissance demands, And turns from them disdainfully its muzzle. It goes on falling, and the more it grows, The more it finds the dogs becoming wolves, This maledict and misadventurous ditch. Descended then through many a hollow gulf, It finds the foxes so replete with fraud, They fear no cunning that may master them. Nor will I cease because another hears me; And well 'twill be for him, if still he mind him Of what a truthful spirit to me unravels. Thy grandson I behold, who doth become A hunter of those wolves upon the bank Of the wild stream, and terrifies them all. He sells their flesh, it being yet alive; Thereafter slaughters them like ancient beeves; Many of life, himself of praise, deprives. Blood-stained he issues from the dismal forest; He leaves it such, a thousand years from now In its primeval state 'tis not re-wooded.\" As at the announcement of impending ills The face of him who listens is disturbed, From whate'er side the peril seize upon him; 202 \nSo I beheld that other soul, which stood Turned round to listen, grow disturbed and sad, When it had gathered to itself the word. The speech of one and aspect of the other Had me desirous made to know their names, And question mixed with prayers I made thereof, Whereat the spirit which first spake to me Began again: \"Thou wishest I should bring me To do for thee what thou'lt not do for me; But since God willeth that in thee shine forth Such grace of his, I'll not be chary with thee; Know, then, that I Guido del Duca am. My blood was so with envy set on fire, That if I had beheld a man make merry, Thou wouldst have seen me sprinkled o'er with pallor. From my own sowing such the straw I reap! O human race! why dost thou set thy heart Where interdict of partnership must be? This is Renier; this is the boast and honour Of the house of Calboli, where no one since Has made himself the heir of his desert. And not alone his blood is made devoid, 'Twixt Po and mount, and sea-shore and the Reno, Of good required for truth and for diversion; For all within these boundaries is full Of venomous roots, so that too tardily By cultivation now would they diminish. Where is good Lizio, and Arrigo Manardi, Pier Traversaro, and Guido di Carpigna, O Romagnuoli into bastards turned? When in Bologna will a Fabbro rise? When in Faenza a Bernardin di Fosco, The noble scion of ignoble seed? Be not astonished, Tuscan, if I weep, When I remember, with Guido da Prata, Ugolin d' Azzo, who was living with us, Frederick Tignoso and his company, The house of Traversara, and th' Anastagi, And one race and the other is extinct; The dames and cavaliers, the toils and ease 203 \nThat filled our souls with love and courtesy, There where the hearts have so malicious grown! O Brettinoro! why dost thou not flee, Seeing that all thy family is gone, And many people, not to be corrupted? Bagnacaval does well in not begetting And ill does Castrocaro, and Conio worse, In taking trouble to beget such Counts. Will do well the Pagani, when their Devil Shall have departed; but not therefore pure Will testimony of them e'er remain. O Ugolin de' Fantoli, secure Thy name is, since no longer is awaited One who, degenerating, can obscure it! But go now, Tuscan, for it now delights me To weep far better than it does to speak, So much has our discourse my mind distressed.\" We were aware that those beloved souls Heard us depart; therefore, by keeping silent, They made us of our pathway confident. When we became alone by going onward, Thunder, when it doth cleave the air, appeared A voice, that counter to us came, exclaiming: \"Shall slay me whosoever findeth me!\" And fled as the reverberation dies If suddenly the cloud asunder bursts. As soon as hearing had a truce from this, Behold another, with so great a crash, That it resembled thunderings following fast: \"I am Aglaurus, who became a stone!\" And then, to press myself close to the Poet, I backward, and not forward, took a step. Already on all sides the air was quiet; And said he to me: \"That was the hard curb That ought to hold a man within his bounds; But you take in the bait so that the hook Of the old Adversary draws you to him, And hence availeth little curb or call. The heavens are calling you, and wheel around you, Displaying to you their eternal beauties, 204 \nAnd still your eye is looking on the ground; Whence He, who all discerns, chastises you.\" 205",
      "modern": "Two souls were speaking of me, leaning close together on my right,\ntheir faces turned upward to address me directly.\n\n\"One travels around our mountain while still alive,\nbefore Death has given him wings to fly,\nopening and closing his eyes at will?\"\n\n\"I don't know who he is, but he's not alone.\nYou're closer—ask him yourself,\nbut speak gently so he'll answer.\"\n\nThen one spirit said to me:\n\"Soul still bound within your body,\nmoving toward heaven—comfort us with charity.\nTell us where you come from and who you are,\nfor you make us marvel at this grace of yours\nas we would at something never seen before.\"\n\nI answered: \"Through the heart of Tuscany\nflows a stream born in the Falterona mountains—\na hundred miles cannot contain its course.\nI bring this body from along its banks.\nTo tell you who I am would be pointless,\nsince my name makes little noise in the world.\"\n\nThe first speaker replied:\n\"If I understand your meaning correctly,\nyou speak of the Arno River.\"\n\nThe other asked: \"Why did he hide\nthe name of that river\nlike something horrible to speak?\"\n\nThe questioned shade answered:\n\"I don't know, but truly\nthe name of such a valley deserves to perish.\nFrom its source in the Alps—where that mountain range\nsplits off Peloro in Sicily\nand surpasses it in few places—\ndown to where it surrenders itself\nto restore what heaven draws up from the sea,\ngiving rivers their flow,\n\nvirtue is avoided like an enemy by everyone,\nfled from like a serpent,\neither through the cursed nature of the place\nor through evil customs that drive them.\n\nThe inhabitants of that wretched valley\nhave so transformed their nature\nit's as if Circe had them in her pasture.\n\nThe river first directs its meager flow\namong filthy swine, more worthy of acorns\nthan food made for human consumption.\n\nThen, flowing downward, it finds curs—\nmore snarling than their strength warrants—\nand turns its snout away in scorn.\n\nThe more it falls and grows,\nthe more it finds dogs becoming wolves\nin this cursed and ill-fated ditch.\n\nDescending through deep ravines,\nit discovers foxes so full of fraud\nthey fear no cunning that might trap them.\n\nI won't stop speaking because another hears—\nit will serve him well to remember\nwhat a truthful spirit reveals to me.\n\nI see your descendant becoming\na hunter of those wolves along the banks\nof that savage stream, terrorizing them all.\n\nHe sells their flesh while they still live,\nthen slaughters them like old cattle.\nMany he robs of life, himself of honor.\n\nBlood-stained, he emerges from the dark forest,\nleaving it so ravaged that a thousand years\nwon't restore its original state.\"\n\nLike a face disturbed by news of coming disaster,\nno matter from which direction peril strikes,\nso I watched that other soul grow troubled and sad\nas it absorbed these words.\n\nThe speech of one and the expression of the other\nmade me eager to know their names,\nand I mixed my questions with prayers.\n\nThe spirit who first spoke began again:\n\"You want me to do for you\nwhat you won't do for me.\nBut since God wills his grace to shine in you,\nI won't be stingy with my answer.\n\nKnow that I am Guido del Duca.\nMy blood burned so hot with envy\nthat seeing any man happy\nwould have turned me pale with rage.\nFrom my own sowing I reap this straw.\n\nO human race!

      "original": "As much as 'twixt the close of the third hour And dawn of day appeareth of that sphere Which aye in fashion of a child is playing, So much it now appeared, towards the night, Was of his course remaining to the sun; There it was evening, and 'twas midnight here; And the rays smote the middle of our faces, Because by us the mount was so encircled, That straight towards the west we now were going When I perceived my forehead overpowered Beneath the splendour far more than at first, And stupor were to me the things unknown, Whereat towards the summit of my brow I raised my hands, and made myself the visor Which the excessive glare diminishes. As when from off the water, or a mirror, The sunbeam leaps unto the opposite side, Ascending upward in the selfsame measure That it descends, and deviates as far From falling of a stone in line direct, (As demonstrate experiment and art,) So it appeared to me that by a light Refracted there before me I was smitten; On which account my sight was swift to flee. \"What is that, Father sweet, from which I cannot So fully screen my sight that it avail me,\" Said I, \"and seems towards us to be moving?\" \"Marvel thou not, if dazzle thee as yet The family of heaven,\" he answered me; 206 \"An angel 'tis, who comes to invite us upward. Soon will it be, that to behold these things Shall not be grievous, but delightful to thee As much as nature fashioned thee to feel.\" When we had reached the Angel benedight, With joyful voice he said: \"Here enter in To stairway far less steep than are the others.\" We mounting were, already thence departed, And \"Beati misericordes\" was Behind us sung, \"Rejoice, thou that o'ercomest!\" My Master and myself, we two alone Were going upward, and I thought, in going, Some profit to acquire from words of his; And I to him directed me, thus asking: \"What did the spirit of Romagna mean, Mentioning interdict and partnership?\" Whence he to me: \"Of his own greatest failing He knows the harm; and therefore wonder not If he reprove us, that we less may rue it. Because are thither pointed your desires Where by companionship each share is lessened, Envy doth ply the bellows to your sighs. But if the love of the supernal sphere Should upwardly direct your aspiration, There would not be that fear within your breast; For there, as much the more as one says 'Our,' So much the more of good each one possesses, And more of charity in that cloister burns.\" \"I am more hungering to be satisfied,\" I said, \"than if I had before been silent, And more of doubt within my mind I gather. How can it be, that boon distributed The more possessors can more wealthy make Therein, than if by few it be possessed?\" And he to me: \"Because thou fixest still Thy mind entirely upon earthly things, Thou pluckest darkness from the very light. That goodness infinite and ineffable Which is above there, runneth unto love, As to a lucid body comes the sunbeam. 207 \nSo much it gives itself as it finds ardour, So that as far as charity extends, O'er it increases the eternal valour. And the more people thitherward aspire, More are there to love well, and more they love there, And, as a mirror, one reflects the other. And if my reasoning appease thee not, Thou shalt see Beatrice; and she will fully Take from thee this and every other longing. Endeavour, then, that soon may be extinct, As are the two already, the five wounds That close themselves again by being painful.\" Even as I wished to say, \"Thou dost appease me,\" I saw that I had reached another circle, So that my eager eyes made me keep silence. There it appeared to me that in a vision Ecstatic on a sudden I was rapt, And in a temple many persons saw; And at the door a woman, with the sweet Behaviour of a mother, saying: \"Son, Why in this manner hast thou dealt with us? Lo, sorrowing, thy father and myself Were seeking for thee;\"—and as here she ceased, That which appeared at first had disappeared. Then I beheld another with those waters Adown her cheeks which grief distils whenever From great disdain of others it is born, And saying: \"If of that city thou art lord, For whose name was such strife among the gods, And whence doth every science scintillate, Avenge thyself on those audacious arms That clasped our daughter, O Pisistratus;\" And the lord seemed to me benign and mild To answer her with aspect temperate: \"What shall we do to those who wish us ill, If he who loves us be by us condemned?\" Then saw I people hot in fire of wrath, With stones a young man slaying, clamorously Still crying to each other, \"Kill him! kill him!\" And him I saw bow down, because of death 208 \nThat weighed already on him, to the earth, But of his eyes made ever gates to heaven, Imploring the high Lord, in so great strife, That he would pardon those his persecutors, With such an aspect as unlocks compassion. Soon as my soul had outwardly returned To things external to it which are true, Did I my not false errors recognize. My Leader, who could see me bear myself Like to a man that rouses him from sleep, Exclaimed: \"What ails thee, that thou canst not stand? But hast been coming more than half a league Veiling thine eyes, and with thy legs entangled, In guise of one whom wine or sleep subdues?\" \"O my sweet Father, if thou listen to me, I'll tell thee,\" said I, \"what appeared to me, When thus from me my legs were ta'en away.\" And he: \"If thou shouldst have a hundred masks Upon thy face, from me would not be shut Thy cogitations, howsoever small. What thou hast seen was that thou mayst not fail To ope thy heart unto the waters of peace, Which from the eternal fountain are diffused. I did not ask, 'What ails thee?' as he does Who only looketh with the eyes that see not When of the soul bereft the body lies, But asked it to give vigour to thy feet; Thus must we needs urge on the sluggards, slow To use their wakefulness when it returns.\" We passed along, athwart the twilight peering Forward as far as ever eye could stretch Against the sunbeams serotine and lucent; And lo! by slow degrees a smoke approached In our direction, sombre as the night, Nor was there place to hide one's self therefrom. This of our eyes and the pure air bereft us. 209",

      "original": "Darkness of hell, and of a night deprived Of every planet under a poor sky, As much as may be tenebrous with cloud, Ne'er made unto my sight so thick a veil, As did that smoke which there enveloped us, Nor to the feeling of so rough a texture; For not an eye it suffered to stay open; Whereat mine escort, faithful and sagacious, Drew near to me and offered me his shoulder. E'en as a blind man goes behind his guide, Lest he should wander, or should strike against Aught that may harm or peradventure kill him, So went I through the bitter and foul air, Listening unto my Leader, who said only, \"Look that from me thou be not separated.\" Voices I heard, and every one appeared To supplicate for peace and misericord The Lamb of God who takes away our sins. Still \"Agnus Dei\" their exordium was; One word there was in all, and metre one, So that all harmony appeared among them. \"Master,\" I said, \"are spirits those I hear?\" And he to me: \"Thou apprehendest truly, And they the knot of anger go unloosing.\" \"Now who art thou, that cleavest through our smoke And art discoursing of us even as though Thou didst by calends still divide the time?\" After this manner by a voice was spoken; Whereon my Master said: \"Do thou reply, And ask if on this side the way go upward.\" 210 And I: \"O creature that dost cleanse thyself To return beautiful to Him who made thee, Thou shalt hear marvels if thou follow me.\" \"Thee will I follow far as is allowed me,\" He answered; \"and if smoke prevent our seeing, Hearing shall keep us joined instead thereof.\" Thereon began I: \"With that swathing band Which death unwindeth am I going upward, And hither came I through the infernal anguish. And if God in his grace has me infolded, So that he wills that I behold his court By method wholly out of modern usage, Conceal not from me who ere death thou wast, But tell it me, and tell me if I go Right for the pass, and be thy words our escort.\" \"Lombard was I, and I was Marco called; The world I knew, and loved that excellence, At which has each one now unbent his bow. For mounting upward, thou art going right.\" Thus he made answer, and subjoined: \"I pray thee To pray for me when thou shalt be above.\" And I to him: \"My faith I pledge to thee To do what thou dost ask me; but am bursting Inly with doubt, unless I rid me of it. First it was simple, and is now made double By thy opinion, which makes certain to me, Here and elsewhere, that which I couple with it. The world forsooth is utterly deserted By every virtue, as thou tellest me, And with iniquity is big and covered; But I beseech thee point me out the cause, That I may see it, and to others show it; For one in the heavens, and here below one puts it.\" A sigh profound, that grief forced into Ai! He first sent forth, and then began he: \"Brother, The world is blind, and sooth thou comest from it! Ye who are living every cause refer Still upward to the heavens, as if all things They of necessity moved with themselves. If this were so, in you would be destroyed 211 \nFree will, nor any justice would there be In having joy for good, or grief for evil. The heavens your movements do initiate, I say not all; but granting that I say it, Light has been given you for good and evil, And free volition; which, if some fatigue In the first battles with the heavens it suffers, Afterwards conquers all, if well 'tis nurtured. To greater force and to a better nature, Though free, ye subject are, and that creates The mind in you the heavens have not in charge. Hence, if the present world doth go astray, In you the cause is, be it sought in you; And I therein will now be thy true spy. Forth from the hand of Him, who fondles it Before it is, like to a little girl Weeping and laughing in her childish sport, Issues the simple soul, that nothing knows, Save that, proceeding from a joyous Maker, Gladly it turns to that which gives it pleasure. Of trivial good at first it tastes the savour; Is cheated by it, and runs after it, If guide or rein turn not aside its love. Hence it behoved laws for a rein to place, Behoved a king to have, who at the least Of the true city should discern the tower. The laws exist, but who sets hand to them? No one; because the shepherd who precedes Can ruminate, but cleaveth not the hoof; Wherefore the people that perceives its guide Strike only at the good for which it hankers, Feeds upon that, and farther seeketh not. Clearly canst thou perceive that evil guidance The cause is that has made the world depraved, And not that nature is corrupt in you. Rome, that reformed the world, accustomed was Two suns to have, which one road and the other, Of God and of the world, made manifest. One has the other quenched, and to the crosier The sword is joined, and ill beseemeth it 212 \nThat by main force one with the other go, Because, being joined, one feareth not the other; If thou believe not, think upon the grain, For by its seed each herb is recognized. In the land laved by Po and Adige, Valour and courtesy used to be found, Before that Frederick had his controversy; Now in security can pass that way Whoever will abstain, through sense of shame, From speaking with the good, or drawing near them. True, three old men are left, in whom upbraids The ancient age the new, and late they deem it That God restore them to the better life: Currado da Palazzo, and good Gherardo, And Guido da Castel, who better named is, In fashion of the French, the simple Lombard: Say thou henceforward that the Church of Rome, Confounding in itself two governments, Falls in the mire, and soils itself and burden.\" \"O Marco mine,\" I said, \"thou reasonest well; And now discern I why the sons of Levi Have been excluded from the heritage. But what Gherardo is it, who, as sample Of a lost race, thou sayest has remained In reprobation of the barbarous age?\" \"Either thy speech deceives me, or it tempts me,\" He answered me; \"for speaking Tuscan to me, It seems of good Gherardo naught thou knowest. By other surname do I know him not, Unless I take it from his daughter Gaia. May God be with you, for I come no farther. Behold the dawn, that through the smoke rays out, Already whitening; and I must depart— Yonder the Angel is—ere he appear.\" Thus did he speak, and would no farther hear me. 213",
      "modern": "Darkness of hell, and of a night stripped\nof every planet beneath a starless sky,\n\nThe thickest cloud-darkened sky\nnever cast so dense a veil across my sight\nas that smoke which wrapped around us there,\nnor felt so coarse against the skin—\nit wouldn't let an eye stay open.\n\nMy faithful, wise escort drew close\nand offered me his shoulder.\nLike a blind man following his guide\nto avoid wandering astray\nor striking something that might harm or kill him,\nso I walked through that bitter, foul air,\nlistening to my Leader, who said only:\n\"Make sure you don't get separated from me.\"\n\nI heard voices, and each one seemed\nto beg for peace and mercy from\nthe Lamb of God who takes away our sins.\nTheir opening was always \"Agnus Dei\"—\none word shared by all, one rhythm,\nso perfect harmony rang among them.\n\n\"Master,\" I said, \"are those spirits I hear?\"\n\nAnd he replied: \"You understand correctly.\nThey're untying the knot of anger.\"\n\n\"Who are you that cuts through our smoke\nand speaks of us as though\nyou still measure time by calendars?\"\n\nSo spoke a voice.\nMy Master said: \"Answer him,\nand ask if the way leads upward on this side.\"\n\n\"O creature cleansing yourself\nto return beautiful to your Maker,\nyou'll hear wonders if you follow me.\"\n\n\"I'll follow as far as I'm allowed,\"\nhe answered. \"If smoke blocks our sight,\nhearing will keep us joined instead.\"\n\nThen I began: \"Wrapped in that binding\nwhich death unwinds, I'm climbing upward.\nI came here through hell's torment.\nSince God has embraced me in his grace\nand wills that I should see his court\nby a method completely unprecedented,\ndon't hide from me who you were before death—\ntell me, and tell me if I'm heading right\nfor the passage. Let your words guide us.\"\n\n\"I was a Lombard, called Marco.\nI knew the world and loved that virtue\nat which everyone has now unstrung their bow.\nYou're going the right way upward.\"\n\nSo he answered, and added: \"I beg you\nto pray for me when you reach heaven.\"\n\n\"I pledge my faith to you,\" I said,\n\"to do what you ask. But I'm bursting\nwith doubt unless I can resolve it.\nFirst it was simple, now it's doubled\nby your words, which confirm for me\nhere and elsewhere what I connect with them.\n\nThe world is utterly abandoned\nby every virtue, as you tell me,\npregnant and covered with wickedness.\nBut I beg you to show me the cause\nso I can see it and reveal it to others—\nfor one blames the heavens, another blames us here below.\"\n\nHe let out a deep sigh\nthat grief forced into \"Ah!\"\nthen began: \"Brother, the world is blind,\nand you truly come from it!\n\nYou living souls refer every cause\nupward to the heavens, as if they\nmoved all things by necessity.\nIf that were so, free will in you\nwould be destroyed, and there'd be no justice\nin joy for good or sorrow for evil.\n\nThe heavens set your impulses in motion—\nnot all of them, but suppose I grant that—\nlight has been given you to know good and evil,\nand free will, which may suffer fatigue\nin its first battles with the heavens\nbut then conquers all if properly nurtured.\n\nFree though you are, you're subject\nto a greater force and better nature,\nand that creates the mind in you—\nthe heavens have no charge over it.\nSo if the present world goes astray,\nthe cause lies in you, seek it in yourselves,\nand I'll be your true guide in this.\n\nFrom the hand of Him who cherishes it\nbefore it exists, like a little girl\nweeping and laughing in childish play,\ncomes forth the simple soul that knows nothing\nexcept that, proceeding from a joyful Maker,\nit turns gladly toward whatever gives it pleasure.\n\nFirst it tastes trivial pleasures,\nis deceived by them, and runs after them\nif no guide or rein redirects its love.\nTherefore laws were needed as a rein,\na king was needed who could at least\ndiscern the tower of the true city.\n\nLaws exist, but who enforces them?\nNo one—because the shepherd who leads\ncan chew the cud but doesn't split the hoof.\nSo the people, seeing their guide\nstrike only at the good he craves,\nfeed on that and seek nothing higher.\n\nYou can clearly see that bad leadership\nis what has corrupted the world,\nnot that your nature is depraved.\n\nRome, which reformed the world,\nwas accustomed to have two suns\nthat lit both roads—\nof God and of the world.\nOne has extinguished the other;\nthe sword is joined to the shepherd's staff,\nand it's wrong for them to go together\nby force, because when joined,\nneither fears the other.\n\nIf you don't believe me, consider the wheat—\neach plant is known by its seed.\nIn the land watered by Po and Adige,\nvalor and courtesy used to flourish\nbefore Frederick's conflict.\nNow anyone can safely travel there\nwho has the shame to avoid\nspeaking with good people or drawing near them.\n\nTrue, three old men remain\nin whom the ancient age rebukes the new,\nand they think it late that God\nrestore them to the better life:\nCurrado da Palazzo, good Gherardo,\nand Guido da Castel, who's better named\nin the French style, the honest Lombard.\n\nSay from now on that Rome's Church,\nconfusing two governments in itself,\nfalls in the mud and soils both itself and its burden.\"\n\n\"My dear Marco,\" I said, \"you reason well,\nand now I understand why Levi's sons\nwere excluded from inheritance.\nBut what Gherardo is this who you say\nremains as an example of the lost race,\nreproaching this barbarous age?\"\n\n\"Either your speech deceives me or tests me,\"\nhe answered, \"for speaking Tuscan to me,\nit seems you know nothing of good Gherardo.\nI know him by no other name\nunless I take it from his daughter Gaia.\nGod be with you—I can go no farther.\nLook, the dawn already rays through the smoke,\ngrowing white.

      "original": "if e'er in the Alps A mist o'ertook thee, through which thou couldst see Not otherwise than through its membrane mole, How, when the vapours humid and condensed Begin to dissipate themselves, the sphere Of the sun feebly enters in among them, And thy imagination will be swift In coming to perceive how I re-saw The sun at first, that was already setting. Thus, to the faithful footsteps of my Master Mating mine own, I issued from that cloud To rays already dead on the low shores. O thou, Imagination, that dost steal us So from without sometimes, that man perceives not, Although around may sound a thousand trumpets, Who moveth thee, if sense impel thee not? Moves thee a light, which in the heaven takes form, By self, or by a will that downward guides it. Of her impiety, who changed her form Into the bird that most delights in singing, In my imagining appeared the trace; And hereupon my mind was so withdrawn Within itself, that from without there came Nothing that then might be received by it. Then reigned within my lofty fantasy One crucified, disdainful and ferocious In countenance, and even thus was dying. Around him were the great Ahasuerus, Esther his wife, and the just Mordecai, 214 Who was in word and action so entire. And even as this image burst asunder Of its own self, in fashion of a bubble In which the water it was made of fails, There rose up in my vision a young maiden Bitterly weeping, and she said: \"O queen, Why hast thou wished in anger to be naught? Thou'st slain thyself, Lavinia not to lose; Now hast thou lost me; I am she who mourns, Mother, at thine ere at another's ruin.\" As sleep is broken, when upon a sudden New light strikes in upon the eyelids closed, And broken quivers ere it dieth wholly, So this imagining of mine fell down As soon as the effulgence smote my face, Greater by far than what is in our wont. I turned me round to see where I might be, When said a voice, \"Here is the passage up;\" Which from all other purposes removed me, And made my wish so full of eagerness To look and see who was it that was speaking, It never rests till meeting face to face; But as before the sun, which quells the sight, And in its own excess its figure veils, Even so my power was insufficient here. \"This is a spirit divine, who in the way Of going up directs us without asking, And who with his own light himself conceals. He does with us as man doth with himself; For he who sees the need, and waits the asking, Malignly leans already tow'rds denial. Accord we now our feet to such inviting, Let us make haste to mount ere it grow dark; For then we could not till the day return.\" Thus my Conductor said; and I and he Together turned our footsteps to a stairway; And I, as soon as the first step I reached, Near me perceived a motion as of wings, And fanning in the face, and saying, \"'Beati Pacifici,' who are without ill anger.\" 215 \nAlready over us were so uplifted The latest sunbeams, which the night pursues, That upon many sides the stars appeared. \"O manhood mine, why dost thou vanish so?\" I said within myself; for I perceived The vigour of my legs was put in truce. We at the point were where no more ascends The stairway upward, and were motionless, Even as a ship, which at the shore arrives; And I gave heed a little, if I might hear Aught whatsoever in the circle new; Then to my Master turned me round and said: \"Say, my sweet Father, what delinquency Is purged here in the circle where we are? Although our feet may pause, pause not thy speech.\" And he to me: \"The love of good, remiss In what it should have done, is here restored; Here plied again the ill-belated oar; But still more openly to understand, Turn unto me thy mind, and thou shalt gather Some profitable fruit from our delay. Neither Creator nor a creature ever, Son,\" he began, \"was destitute of love Natural or spiritual; and thou knowest it. The natural was ever without error; But err the other may by evil object, Or by too much, or by too little vigour. While in the first it well directed is, And in the second moderates itself, It cannot be the cause of sinful pleasure; But when to ill it turns, and, with more care Or lesser than it ought, runs after good, 'Gainst the Creator works his own creation. Hence thou mayst comprehend that love must be The seed within yourselves of every virtue, And every act that merits punishment. Now inasmuch as never from the welfare Of its own subject can love turn its sight, From their own hatred all things are secure; And since we cannot think of any being 216 \nStanding alone, nor from the First divided, Of hating Him is all desire cut off. Hence if, discriminating, I judge well, The evil that one loves is of one's neighbour, And this is born in three modes in your clay. There are, who, by abasement of their neighbour, Hope to excel, and therefore only long That from his greatness he may be cast down; There are, who power, grace, honour, and renown Fear they may lose because another rises, Thence are so sad that the reverse they love; And there are those whom injury seems to chafe, So that it makes them greedy for revenge, And such must needs shape out another's harm. This threefold love is wept for down below; Now of the other will I have thee hear, That runneth after good with measure faulty. Each one confusedly a good conceives Wherein the mind may rest, and longeth for it; Therefore to overtake it each one strives. If languid love to look on this attract you, Or in attaining unto it, this cornice, After just penitence, torments you for it. There's other good that does not make man happy; 'Tis not felicity, 'tis not the good Essence, of every good the fruit and root. The love that yields itself too much to this Above us is lamented in three circles; But how tripartite it may be described, I say not, that thou seek it for thyself.\" 217",
      "modern": "If you have ever been caught in Alpine mist\nso thick you could see no better\nthan a mole sees through its own skin—\nthen you know how, when the heavy vapors\nbegin to thin and scatter,\nthe sun's sphere pushes weakly through,\npale and struggling.\nYour imagination will quickly grasp\nhow I saw the sun again,\nalready setting as it was.\n\nMatching my steps to my Master's faithful footsteps,\nI emerged from that cloud\ninto rays already dying on the distant shores.\n\nO Imagination, you who steal us so completely\nfrom the outer world that we perceive nothing—\nnot even if a thousand trumpets blared around us—\nwhat moves you when the senses give you nothing?\nA light moves you, taking form in heaven\nby itself, or by some will that guides it downward.\n\nIn my mind appeared the trace\nof her wickedness—she who transformed herself\ninto the bird that most loves to sing.\nMy consciousness withdrew so deeply\ninto itself that nothing from outside\ncould enter or be received.\n\nThen in my soaring fantasy there reigned\none crucified, scornful and fierce\nin his expression, dying just as he had lived.\nAround him stood great Ahasuerus,\nEsther his wife, and righteous Mordecai,\nwho was so complete in word and deed.\n\nAs this vision burst apart\nof its own accord, like a bubble\nwhen the water that formed it fails,\nthere rose in my sight a young woman\nweeping bitterly, crying: \"O queen,\nwhy did you choose in anger to become nothing?\nYou killed yourself so as not to lose Lavinia—\nnow you have lost me!

Now may apparent be to thee how hidden The truth is from those people, who aver All love is in itself a laudable thing; Because its matter may perchance appear Aye to be good; but yet not each impression Is good, albeit good may be the wax.\" \"Thy words, and my sequacious intellect,\" I answered him, \"have love revealed to me; But that has made me more impregned with doubt; For if love from without be offered us, And with another foot the soul go not, If right or wrong she go, 'tis not her merit.\" And he to me: \"What reason seeth here, Myself can tell thee; beyond that await For Beatrice, since 'tis a work of faith. Every substantial form, that segregate From matter is, and with it is united, Specific power has in itself collected, Which without act is not perceptible, Nor shows itself except by its effect, As life does in a plant by the green leaves. But still, whence cometh the intelligence Of the first notions, man is ignorant, And the affection for the first allurements, Which are in you as instinct in the bee To make its honey; and this first desire Merit of praise or blame containeth not. Now, that to this all others may be gathered, Innate within you is the power that counsels, And it should keep the threshold of assent. This is the principle, from which is taken Occasion of desert in you, according As good and guilty loves it takes and winnows. Those who, in reasoning, to the bottom went, Were of this innate liberty aware, Therefore bequeathed they Ethics to the world. 219 \nSupposing, then, that from necessity Springs every love that is within you kindled, Within yourselves the power is to restrain it. The noble virtue Beatrice understands By the free will; and therefore see that thou Bear it in mind, if she should speak of it.\" The moon, belated almost unto midnight, Now made the stars appear to us more rare, Formed like a bucket, that is all ablaze, And counter to the heavens ran through those paths Which the sun sets aflame, when he of Rome Sees it 'twixt Sardes and Corsicans go down; And that patrician shade, for whom is named Pietola more than any Mantuan town, Had laid aside the burden of my lading; Whence I, who reason manifest and plain In answer to my questions had received, Stood like a man in drowsy reverie. But taken from me was this drowsiness Suddenly by a people, that behind Our backs already had come round to us. And as, of old, Ismenus and Asopus Beside them saw at night the rush and throng, If but the Thebans were in need of Bacchus, So they along that circle curve their step, From what I saw of those approaching us, Who by good-will and righteous love are ridden. Full soon they were upon us, because running Moved onward all that mighty multitude, And two in the advance cried out, lamenting, \"Mary in haste unto the mountain ran, And Caesar, that he might subdue Ilerda, Thrust at Marseilles, and then ran into Spain.\" \"Quick! quick! so that the time may not be lost By little love!\" forthwith the others cried, \"For ardour in well-doing freshens grace!\" \"O folk, in whom an eager fervour now Supplies perhaps delay and negligence, Put by you in well-doing, through lukewarmness, This one who lives, and truly I lie not, 220 \nWould fain go up, if but the sun relight us; So tell us where the passage nearest is.\" These were the words of him who was my Guide; And some one of those spirits said: \"Come on Behind us, and the opening shalt thou find; So full of longing are we to move onward, That stay we cannot; therefore pardon us, If thou for churlishness our justice take. I was San Zeno's Abbot at Verona, Under the empire of good Barbarossa, Of whom still sorrowing Milan holds discourse; And he has one foot in the grave already, Who shall erelong lament that monastery, And sorry be of having there had power, Because his son, in his whole body sick, And worse in mind, and who was evil-born, He put into the place of its true pastor.\" If more he said, or silent was, I know not, He had already passed so far beyond us; But this I heard, and to retain it pleased me. And he who was in every need my succour Said: \"Turn thee hitherward; see two of them Come fastening upon slothfulness their teeth.\" In rear of all they shouted: \"Sooner were The people dead to whom the sea was opened, Than their inheritors the Jordan saw; And those who the fatigue did not endure Unto the issue, with Anchises' son, Themselves to life withouten glory offered.\" Then when from us so separated were Those shades, that they no longer could be seen, Within me a new thought did entrance find, Whence others many and diverse were born; And so I lapsed from one into another, That in a reverie mine eyes I closed, And meditation into dream transmuted. 221",
      "modern": "The great Teacher had finished his reasoning\nand looked intently into my face,\n\nI remained silent, though I appeared content,\nfor a new thirst still drove me forward.\nWithout, I was mute, but within I said:\n\"Perhaps my endless questions annoy him.\"\n\nBut that true Father, who understood\nmy timid wish that would not reveal itself,\ngave me courage to speak by speaking first.\n\nSo I began: \"Master, my sight is so enlivened\nby your light that I clearly discern\nwhatever your words convey or describe.\nTherefore I beg you, sweet Father,\nteach me about love, to which you refer\nevery good action and its opposite.\"\n\n\"Direct toward me,\" he said, \"the sharp eyes\nof your intellect, and the error will be clear—\nthe error of the blind who would be guides.\n\nThe soul, created with the capacity to love,\nmoves toward everything that pleases,\nas soon as pleasure awakens it to action.\nYour perception draws an image\nfrom some real thing and displays it within you\nso that it makes the soul turn toward it.\n\nAnd if, when turned, the soul inclines toward it,\nthat inclination is love—it is nature\nbound anew in you by pleasure.\nThen, just as fire moves upward\nby its own form, born to ascend\nwhere it endures longest in its matter,\nso the captive soul enters desire,\nwhich is a spiritual motion that never rests\nuntil it enjoys the beloved thing.\n\nNow it should be clear to you how hidden\nthe truth is from those people who claim\nthat all love is in itself praiseworthy.\nFor though love's matter may perhaps appear\nalways to be good, not every impression\nis good, however good the wax may be.\"\n\n\"Your words and my attentive mind,\"\nI answered him, \"have revealed love to me,\nbut this has filled me with greater doubt.\nFor if love comes to us from outside,\nand the soul walks with no other foot,\nwhether she goes right or wrong is not her merit.\"\n\nAnd he replied: \"What reason sees here,\nI can tell you. Beyond that, wait\nfor Beatrice, since it is a matter of faith.\n\nEvery substantial form that is separate\nfrom matter yet united with it\nhas specific power gathered in itself,\nwhich cannot be perceived without action\nand shows itself only through its effects,\nas life does in a plant through green leaves.\n\nBut man remains ignorant of where comes\nthe understanding of first principles\nand the attraction to first allurements,\nwhich exist in you as instinct exists in the bee\nto make honey.

Quick! Let no time be lost\nthrough little love!\" the others cried at once.\n\"Fervor in doing good refreshes grace!\"\n\n\"O people in whom eager zeal now perhaps\nmakes up for the delay and negligence\nyou showed in doing good through lukewarmness—\nthis living man (and truly I do not lie)\nwants to ascend when the sun shines on us again,\nso tell us where the passage is nearest.\"\n\nThese were my Guide's words, and one\nof those spirits answered: \"Follow behind us\nand you will find the opening.\nWe are so full of longing to move forward\nthat we cannot stay, so forgive us\nif you take our justice for rudeness.\n\nI was Abbot of San Zeno in Verona\nunder the rule of good Barbarossa,\nof whom Milan still speaks with sorrow.\nAnd one man already has one foot in the grave\nwho will soon lament that monastery\nand regret having held power there,\nbecause he put his son in place\nof its true pastor—his son, sick in body\nand worse in mind, and born in sin.\"\n\nWhether he said more or fell silent, I don't know—\nhe had already passed so far beyond us.\nBut I heard this much and was pleased to remember it.\n\nAnd he who was my help in every need said:\n\"Turn this way and see two of them\nfastening their teeth upon sloth.\"\n\nAt the rear of all, they shouted: \"The people\nfor whom the sea opened were already dead\nbefore their heirs saw the Jordan.\nAnd those who did not endure the hardship\nto the end with Anchises' son\nsurrendered themselves to a life without glory.\"\n\nThen, when those shades were so separated from us\nthat they could no longer be seen,\na new thought entered my mind,\nfrom which many others, diverse, were born.\nAnd so I slipped from one to another\nuntil I closed my eyes in reverie\nand transformed meditation into dream.",

      "original": "when the diurnal heat No more can warm the coldness of the moon, Vanquished by earth, or peradventure Saturn, When geomancers their Fortuna Major See in the orient before the dawn Rise by a path that long remains not dim, There came to me in dreams a stammering woman, Squint in her eyes, and in her feet distorted, With hands dissevered and of sallow hue. I looked at her; and as the sun restores The frigid members which the night benumbs, Even thus my gaze did render voluble Her tongue, and made her all erect thereafter In little while, and the lost countenance As love desires it so in her did colour. When in this wise she had her speech unloosed, She 'gan to sing so, that with difficulty Could I have turned my thoughts away from her. \"I am,\" she sang, \"I am the Siren sweet Who mariners amid the main unman, So full am I of pleasantness to hear. I drew Ulysses from his wandering way Unto my song, and he who dwells with me Seldom departs so wholly I content him.\" Her mouth was not yet closed again, before Appeared a Lady saintly and alert Close at my side to put her to confusion. \"Virgilius, O Virgilius! who is this?\" Sternly she said; and he was drawing near 222 With eyes still fixed upon that modest one. She seized the other and in front laid open, Rending her garments, and her belly showed me; This waked me with the stench that issued from it. I turned mine eyes, and good Virgilius said: \"At least thrice have I called thee; rise and come; Find we the opening by which thou mayst enter.\" I rose; and full already of high day Were all the circles of the Sacred Mountain, And with the new sun at our back we went. Following behind him, I my forehead bore Like unto one who has it laden with thought, Who makes himself the half arch of a bridge, When I heard say, \"Come, here the passage is,\" Spoken in a manner gentle and benign, Such as we hear not in this mortal region. With open wings, which of a swan appeared, Upward he turned us who thus spake to us, Between the two walls of the solid granite. He moved his pinions afterwards and fanned us, Affirming those 'qui lugent' to be blessed, For they shall have their souls with comfort filled. \"What aileth thee, that aye to earth thou gazest?\" To me my Guide began to say, we both Somewhat beyond the Angel having mounted. And I: \"With such misgiving makes me go A vision new, which bends me to itself, So that I cannot from the thought withdraw me.\" \"Didst thou behold,\" he said, \"that old enchantress, Who sole above us henceforth is lamented? Didst thou behold how man is freed from her? Suffice it thee, and smite earth with thy heels, Thine eyes lift upward to the lure, that whirls The Eternal King with revolutions vast.\" Even as the hawk, that first his feet surveys, Then turns him to the call and stretches forward, Through the desire of food that draws him thither, Such I became, and such, as far as cleaves The rock to give a way to him who mounts, Went on to where the circling doth begin. 223 \nOn the fifth circle when I had come forth, People I saw upon it who were weeping, Stretched prone upon the ground, all downward turned. \"Adhaesit pavimento anima mea,\" I heard them say with sighings so profound, That hardly could the words be understood. \"O ye elect of God, whose sufferings Justice and Hope both render less severe, Direct ye us towards the high ascents.\" \"If ye are come secure from this prostration, And wish to find the way most speedily, Let your right hands be evermore outside.\" Thus did the Poet ask, and thus was answered By them somewhat in front of us; whence I In what was spoken divined the rest concealed, And unto my Lord's eyes mine eyes I turned; Whence he assented with a cheerful sign To what the sight of my desire implored. When of myself I could dispose at will, Above that creature did I draw myself, Whose words before had caused me to take note, Saying: \"O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens That without which to God we cannot turn, Suspend awhile for me thy greater care. Who wast thou, and why are your backs turned upwards, Tell me, and if thou wouldst that I procure thee Anything there whence living I departed.\" And he to me: \"Wherefore our backs the heaven Turns to itself, know shalt thou; but beforehand 'Scias quod ego fui successor Petri.' Between Siestri and Chiaveri descends A river beautiful, and of its name The title of my blood its summit makes. A month and little more essayed I how Weighs the great cloak on him from mire who keeps it, For all the other burdens seem a feather. Tardy, ah woe is me! was my conversion; But when the Roman Shepherd I was made, Then I discovered life to be a lie. I saw that there the heart was not at rest, 224 \nNor farther in that life could one ascend; Whereby the love of this was kindled in me. Until that time a wretched soul and parted From God was I, and wholly avaricious; Now, as thou seest, I here am punished for it. What avarice does is here made manifest In the purgation of these souls converted, And no more bitter pain the Mountain has. Even as our eye did not uplift itself Aloft, being fastened upon earthly things, So justice here has merged it in the earth. As avarice had extinguished our affection For every good, whereby was action lost, So justice here doth hold us in restraint, Bound and imprisoned by the feet and hands; And so long as it pleases the just Lord Shall we remain immovable and prostrate.\" I on my knees had fallen, and wished to speak; But even as I began, and he was 'ware, Only by listening, of my reverence, \"What cause,\" he said, \"has downward bent thee thus?\" And I to him: \"For your own dignity, Standing, my conscience stung me with remorse.\" \"Straighten thy legs, and upward raise thee, brother,\" He answered: \"Err not, fellow-servant am I With thee and with the others to one power. If e'er that holy, evangelic sound, Which sayeth 'neque nubent,' thou hast heard, Well canst thou see why in this wise I speak. Now go; no longer will I have thee linger, Because thy stay doth incommode my weeping, With which I ripen that which thou hast said. On earth I have a grandchild named Alagia, Good in herself, unless indeed our house Malevolent may make her by example, And she alone remains to me on earth.\" 225",
      "modern": "When the daily heat can no longer warm\nthe cold face of the moon,\novercome by earth's shadow, or perhaps by Saturn,\nwhen fortune-tellers see their Greater Fortune\nrising in the east before dawn\nalong a path that stays bright for long—\n\nthere came to me in dreams a stammering woman,\ncross-eyed and twisted in her feet,\nwith severed hands and sallow skin.\n\nI stared at her, and as the sun restores\nfrozen limbs that night has numbed,\nso my gaze made her tongue flow freely,\nstraightened her posture in moments,\nand colored her lost features\nwith the beauty that love desires.\n\nWhen she had freed her voice this way,\nshe began to sing so sweetly\nI could barely turn my thoughts away.\n\n\"I am,\" she sang, \"I am the sweet Siren\nwho unmans sailors on the open sea,\nso full of pleasure am I to hear.\nI drew Ulysses from his wandering course\nto my song, and whoever stays with me\nrarely leaves, so completely do I satisfy.\"\n\nBefore her mouth had closed again,\na holy and alert Lady appeared\nat my side to shame her.\n\n\"Virgil, O Virgil! Who is this?\"\nshe said sternly, and he approached\nwith eyes fixed on that modest one.\n\nShe seized the other and tore open her front,\nripping her clothes to show me her belly—\nI woke from the stench that poured out.\n\nI turned my eyes, and good Virgil said:\n\"I've called you at least three times—get up and come.\nLet's find the opening where you can enter.\"\n\nI rose. Already the full light of day\nfilled all the circles of the Sacred Mountain,\nand we walked with the new sun at our backs.\n\nFollowing behind him, I carried my head\nlike someone heavy with thought,\nmaking myself half an arch of a bridge,\n\nwhen I heard spoken, \"Come, the passage is here,\"\nin a voice so gentle and kind\nwe never hear such tones in this mortal world.\n\nWith wings spread wide like a swan's,\nhe who spoke to us guided us upward\nbetween two walls of solid granite.\n\nThen he moved his feathers and fanned us,\ndeclaring blessed those \"who mourn,\"\nfor their souls shall be filled with comfort.\n\n\"What troubles you, that you keep staring at the ground?\"\nmy Guide began to ask, after we had climbed\nsomewhat beyond the Angel.\n\nAnd I replied: \"A new vision fills me with such unease,\nbending me toward itself so powerfully\nI cannot pull my thoughts away.\"\n\n\"Did you see,\" he said, \"that ancient enchantress\nwho alone is now lamented above us?\nDid you see how man frees himself from her?\n\nLet that be enough—strike the earth with your heels\nand lift your eyes to the lure that spins\nfrom the Eternal King's vast revolutions.\"\n\nLike a hawk that first looks down at its feet,\nthen turns toward the call and stretches forward\nthrough desire for the food that draws it,\n\nso I became, and climbed as far as the rock\nsplits open to give passage to those ascending,\nuntil I reached where the circling begins.\n\nWhen I emerged onto the fifth circle,\nI saw people weeping there,\nlying face-down, stretched flat on the ground.\n\n\"My soul cleaves to the pavement,\"\nI heard them say with sighs so deep\nthe words could hardly be understood.\n\n\"O chosen of God, whose sufferings\nboth Justice and Hope make lighter,\ndirect us toward the high ascents.\"\n\n\"If you have come safe from this prostration\nand wish to find the fastest way,\nalways keep your right hands toward the outside.\"\n\nSo the Poet asked, and so was answered\nby those somewhat ahead of us, from which\nI understood what their words concealed.\n\nI turned my eyes to my Lord's eyes,\nand he nodded with a cheerful sign\nat what my look of desire requested.\n\nWhen I could move as I wished,\nI positioned myself above that soul\nwhose words had earlier caught my attention,\n\nsaying: \"O Spirit, in whom weeping ripens\nthat without which we cannot turn to God,\npause your greater care for me a moment.\n\nWho were you, and why are your backs turned skyward?\nTell me, and would you have me obtain\nanything there, from where I departed living?\"\n\nAnd he replied: \"Why heaven turns\nour backs to itself, you shall know,\nbut first, 'Know that I was Peter's successor.'\n\nBetween Sestri and Chiavari flows\na beautiful river, and from its name\nthe title of my family takes its honor.\n\nFor a month and little more I learned\nhow heavy the great mantle weighs on one\nwho keeps it from the mud—all other burdens feel like feathers.\n\nMy conversion came late—woe is me!\nBut when I was made Roman Shepherd,\nI discovered that life was a lie.\n\nI saw the heart found no rest there,\nnor could one climb higher in that life,\nso love for this life was kindled in me.\n\nUntil then I was a wretched soul,\nseparated from God and wholly greedy.\nNow, as you see, I am punished for it here.\n\nWhat avarice does is made clear\nin the purification of these converted souls—\nthe Mountain holds no more bitter pain.\n\nJust as our eyes never lifted themselves\nupward, being fixed on earthly things,\nso justice here has pressed them into earth.\n\nAs greed extinguished our love\nfor every good thing, destroying action,\nso justice holds us here in restraint,\n\nbound and imprisoned by hands and feet.\nAs long as it pleases the just Lord,\nwe shall remain motionless and prostrate.\"\n\nI had fallen to my knees, wanting to speak,\nbut as I began, he became aware\njust by listening to my reverence.\n\n\"What reason,\" he said, \"has bent you down like this?\"\n\nAnd I replied: \"Your dignity\nstanding made my conscience sting with remorse.\"\n\n\"Straighten your legs and raise yourself up, brother,\"\nhe answered. \"Do not err—I am a fellow servant\nwith you and the others under one power.\n\nIf you have ever heard that holy gospel sound\nthat says 'they neither marry,'\nyou can clearly see why I speak this way.\n\nNow go—I will not have you linger longer,\nbecause your staying hinders my weeping,\nwith which I ripen what you have described.\n\nI have a granddaughter on earth named Alagia,\ngood in herself, unless our house\ncorrupts her by its evil example—\nshe alone remains to me there.\"",

      "original": "Ill strives the will against a better will; Therefore, to pleasure him, against my pleasure I drew the sponge not saturate from the water. Onward I moved, and onward moved my Leader, Through vacant places, skirting still the rock, As on a wall close to the battlements; For they that through their eyes pour drop by drop The malady which all the world pervades, On the other side too near the verge approach. Accursed mayst thou be, thou old she-wolf, That more than all the other beasts hast prey, Because of hunger infinitely hollow! O heaven, in whose gyrations some appear To think conditions here below are changed, When will he come through whom she shall depart? Onward we went with footsteps slow and scarce, And I attentive to the shades I heard Piteously weeping and bemoaning them; And I by peradventure heard \"Sweet Mary!\" Uttered in front of us amid the weeping Even as a woman does who is in child-birth; And in continuance: \"How poor thou wast Is manifested by that hostelry Where thou didst lay thy sacred burden down.\" Thereafterward I heard: \"O good Fabricius, Virtue with poverty didst thou prefer To the possession of great wealth with vice.\" So pleasurable were these words to me 226 That I drew farther onward to have knowledge Touching that spirit whence they seemed to come. He furthermore was speaking of the largess Which Nicholas unto the maidens gave, In order to conduct their youth to honour. \"O soul that dost so excellently speak, Tell me who wast thou,\" said I, \"and why only Thou dost renew these praises well deserved? Not without recompense shall be thy word, If I return to finish the short journey Of that life which is flying to its end.\" And he: \"I'll tell thee, not for any comfort I may expect from earth, but that so much Grace shines in thee or ever thou art dead. I was the root of that malignant plant Which overshadows all the Christian world, So that good fruit is seldom gathered from it; But if Douay and Ghent, and Lille and Bruges Had Power, soon vengeance would be taken on it; And this I pray of Him who judges all. Hugh Capet was I called upon the earth; From me were born the Louises and Philips, By whom in later days has France been governed. I was the son of a Parisian butcher, What time the ancient kings had perished all, Excepting one, contrite in cloth of gray. I found me grasping in my hands the rein Of the realm's government, and so great power Of new acquest, and so with friends abounding, That to the widowed diadem promoted The head of mine own offspring was, from whom The consecrated bones of these began. So long as the great dowry of Provence Out of my blood took not the sense of shame, 'Twas little worth, but still it did no harm. Then it began with falsehood and with force Its rapine; and thereafter, for amends, Took Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony. Charles came to Italy, and for amends A victim made of Conradin, and then 227 \nThrust Thomas back to heaven, for amends. A time I see, not very distant now, Which draweth forth another Charles from France, The better to make known both him and his. Unarmed he goes, and only with the lance That Judas jousted with; and that he thrusts So that he makes the paunch of Florence burst. He thence not land, but sin and infamy, Shall gain, so much more grievous to himself As the more light such damage he accounts. The other, now gone forth, ta'en in his ship, See I his daughter sell, and chaffer for her As corsairs do with other female slaves. What more, O Avarice, canst thou do to us, Since thou my blood so to thyself hast drawn, It careth not for its own proper flesh? That less may seem the future ill and past, I see the flower-de-luce Alagna enter, And Christ in his own Vicar captive made. I see him yet another time derided; I see renewed the vinegar and gall, And between living thieves I see him slain. I see the modern Pilate so relentless, This does not sate him, but without decretal He to the temple bears his sordid sails! When, O my Lord! shall I be joyful made By looking on the vengeance which, concealed, Makes sweet thine anger in thy secrecy? What I was saying of that only bride Of the Holy Ghost, and which occasioned thee To turn towards me for some commentary, So long has been ordained to all our prayers As the day lasts; but when the night comes on, Contrary sound we take instead thereof. At that time we repeat Pygmalion, Of whom a traitor, thief, and parricide Made his insatiable desire of gold; And the misery of avaricious Midas, That followed his inordinate demand, At which forevermore one needs but laugh. 228 \nThe foolish Achan each one then records, And how he stole the spoils; so that the wrath Of Joshua still appears to sting him here. Then we accuse Sapphira with her husband, We laud the hoof-beats Heliodorus had, And the whole mount in infamy encircles Polymnestor who murdered Polydorus. Here finally is cried: 'O Crassus, tell us, For thou dost know, what is the taste of gold?' Sometimes we speak, one loud, another low, According to desire of speech, that spurs us To greater now and now to lesser pace. But in the good that here by day is talked of, Erewhile alone I was not; yet near by No other person lifted up his voice.\" From him already we departed were, And made endeavour to o'ercome the road As much as was permitted to our power, When I perceived, like something that is falling, The mountain tremble, whence a chill seized on me, As seizes him who to his death is going. Certes so violently shook not Delos, Before Latona made her nest therein To give birth to the two eyes of the heaven. Then upon all sides there began a cry, Such that the Master drew himself towards me, Saying, \"Fear not, while I am guiding thee.\" \"Gloria in excelsis Deo,\" all Were saying, from what near I comprehended, Where it was possible to hear the cry. We paused immovable and in suspense, Even as the shepherds who first heard that song, Until the trembling ceased, and it was finished. Then we resumed again our holy path, Watching the shades that lay upon the ground, Already turned to their accustomed plaint. No ignorance ever with so great a strife Had rendered me importunate to know, If erreth not in this my memory, As meditating then I seemed to have; 229 \nNor out of haste to question did I dare, Nor of myself I there could aught perceive; So I went onward timorous and thoughtful. 230",
      "modern": "A will struggles badly against a better will;\nso to please him, against my own desire,\nI drew back the sponge.\n\nWe moved forward, my guide and I, through the empty spaces\nalong the rock face, like walkers on a wall beside the battlements.\nThose souls who weep their endless tears—\nthe sickness that infects the entire world—\npressed too close to the cliff's edge on the other side.\n\nCursed are you, ancient she-wolf of greed,\nwho devour more prey than all other beasts\nbecause your hunger can never be filled!\nO heaven, whose turning some believe\ncan change conditions here below,\nwhen will he come who will drive her away?\n\nWe walked on with slow and careful steps,\nand I listened intently to the shades\nI heard weeping and lamenting piteously.\nBy chance I heard someone cry \"Sweet Mary!\"\nfrom ahead of us, amid the weeping,\nlike a woman in the throes of childbirth.\n\nThe voice continued: \"How poor you were\nis shown by that humble inn\nwhere you laid down your sacred burden.\"\n\nThen I heard: \"O noble Fabricius,\nyou chose virtue with poverty\nover the possession of great wealth with vice.\"\n\nThese words gave me such pleasure\nthat I moved closer to learn more\nabout the spirit from whom they seemed to come.\n\nHe was speaking now of the generosity\nNicholas showed to the young maidens,\nguiding their youth toward honor.\n\n\"O soul who speaks so excellently,\ntell me who you were,\" I said, \"and why\nare you alone in renewing these well-deserved praises?\nYour words will not go unrewarded\nif I return to complete the brief journey\nof this life that flies toward its end.\"\n\nAnd he replied: \"I'll tell you, not for any comfort\nI might expect from earth, but because such grace\nshines in you before you have even died.\n\nI was the root of that poisonous tree\nwhich casts its shadow over all the Christian lands,\nso that good fruit is rarely gathered from it.\nBut if Douai and Ghent and Lille and Bruges\nhad the power, they would soon take vengeance on it—\nand this I pray from Him who judges all.\n\nOn earth I was called Hugh Capet.\nFrom me were born the Louises and Philips\nwho have ruled France in later days.\nI was the son of a Parisian butcher\nwhen all the ancient kings had perished\nexcept one, repentant in gray cloth.\n\nI found myself grasping the reins\nof the kingdom's government, with such great power\nfrom new acquisitions, and so many friends,\nthat my own son's head was promoted\nto the widowed crown, from whom\nthe consecrated bones of these kings began.\n\nAs long as the great dowry of Provence\ndid not strip the shame from my bloodline,\nit was worth little, but at least did no harm.\nThen with lies and force\nit began its pillaging, and afterward, to make amends,\nseized Ponthieu, Normandy, and Gascony.\n\nCharles came to Italy, and for amends\nmade a victim of Conradin, and then\nsent Thomas back to heaven, for amends.\n\nI see a time, not far distant now,\nthat will bring forth another Charles from France\nto make both himself and his family better known.\nHe goes unarmed, carrying only the lance\nthat Judas wielded, and he thrusts it so\nthat he bursts the belly of Florence.\n\nFrom this he'll gain not territory, but sin and shame—\nall the more grievous to himself\nbecause he considers such damage so lightly.\nThe other one, already departed on his ship,\nI see selling his own daughter, bargaining for her\nlike pirates do with other female slaves.\n\nWhat more can you do to us, Avarice,\nsince you have so drawn my blood to yourself\nthat it no longer cares for its own flesh?\nTo make the future and past evil seem less,\nI see the fleur-de-lis enter Alagna\nand Christ made captive in his own vicar.\n\nI see him mocked yet again,\nI see the vinegar and gall renewed,\nand him slain between living thieves.\nI see the new Pilate, so pitiless\nthat this does not satisfy him—without decree\nhe brings his greedy sails into the temple.\n\nO my Lord, when shall I be made joyful\nby seeing the vengeance that, hidden,\nmakes your anger sweet in your secrecy?\"\n\nWhat I was saying about that sole bride\nof the Holy Spirit, which made you turn\nto me for explanation, continues\nas the prescribed response to all our prayers\nas long as day lasts. But when night comes,\nwe take up the contrary examples instead.\n\nThen we repeat the story of Pygmalion,\nwhom his insatiable lust for gold\nmade traitor, thief, and parricide;\nand the misery of greedy Midas\nthat followed his unreasonable request,\nat which one can only laugh forever.\n\nEach soul then recalls foolish Achan\nand how he stole the spoils, so that Joshua's wrath\nstill seems to sting him here.\nThen we accuse Sapphira and her husband,\nwe praise the hoofbeats that trampled Heliodorus,\nand the whole mountain echoes with the infamy\nof Polymnestor, who murdered Polydorus.\n\nFinally comes the cry: 'Tell us, Crassus,\nfor you know—what does gold taste like?'\nSometimes we speak loudly, sometimes softly,\naccording to the desire that spurs us\nto greater or lesser intensity.\n\nBut in speaking of the good examples told by day,\nI was not alone just now—though nearby\nno other soul was raising his voice.\"\n\nWe had already left him behind\nand were striving to advance along the path\nas much as our strength allowed,\nwhen I felt the mountain tremble\nlike something about to fall, and a chill seized me\nlike one who goes to his death.\n\nCertainly Delos did not shake so violently\nbefore Latona made her nest there\nto give birth to heaven's two eyes.\n\nThen on all sides began such a cry\nthat my master drew close to me,\nsaying, \"Do not fear while I am your guide.\"\n\n\"Glory to God in the highest!\" everyone\nwas saying, from what I could understand\nwhere it was possible to hear the words.\n\nWe stood motionless and in suspense,\nlike the shepherds who first heard that song,\nuntil the trembling ceased and was finished.\n\nThen we resumed our sacred journey,\nwatching the shades lying on the ground,\nalready returned to their accustomed lament.\n\nNever had ignorance assaulted me\nwith such great urgency to know—\nif my memory does not err in this—\nas I seemed to feel while pondering then.\nBut I dared not ask out of haste,\nnor could I perceive anything by myself,\nso I went forward, fearful and thoughtful.",

      "original": "The natural thirst, that ne'er is satisfied Excepting with the water for whose grace The woman of Samaria besought, Put me in travail, and haste goaded me Along the encumbered path behind my Leader And I was pitying that righteous vengeance; And lo! in the same manner as Luke writeth That Christ appeared to two upon the way From the sepulchral cave already risen, A shade appeared to us, and came behind us, Down gazing on the prostrate multitude, Nor were we ware of it, until it spake, Saying, \"My brothers, may God give you peace!\" We turned us suddenly, and Virgilius rendered To him the countersign thereto conforming. Thereon began he: \"In the blessed council, Thee may the court veracious place in peace, That me doth banish in eternal exile!\" \"How,\" said he, and the while we went with speed, \"If ye are shades whom God deigns not on high, Who up his stairs so far has guided you?\" And said my Teacher: \"If thou note the marks Which this one bears, and which the Angel traces Well shalt thou see he with the good must reign. But because she who spinneth day and night For him had not yet drawn the distaff off, Which Clotho lays for each one and compacts, His soul, which is thy sister and my own, In coming upwards could not come alone, By reason that it sees not in our fashion. 231 Whence I was drawn from out the ample throat Of Hell to be his guide, and I shall guide him As far on as my school has power to lead. But tell us, if thou knowest, why such a shudder Erewhile the mountain gave, and why together All seemed to cry, as far as its moist feet?\" In asking he so hit the very eye Of my desire, that merely with the hope My thirst became the less unsatisfied. \"Naught is there,\" he began, \"that without order May the religion of the mountain feel, Nor aught that may be foreign to its custom. Free is it here from every permutation; What from itself heaven in itself receiveth Can be of this the cause, and naught beside; Because that neither rain, nor hail, nor snow, Nor dew, nor hoar-frost any higher falls Than the short, little stairway of three steps. Dense clouds do not appear, nor rarefied, Nor coruscation, nor the daughter of Thaumas, That often upon earth her region shifts; No arid vapour any farther rises Than to the top of the three steps I spake of, Whereon the Vicar of Peter has his feet. Lower down perchance it trembles less or more, But, for the wind that in the earth is hidden I know not how, up here it never trembled. It trembles here, whenever any soul Feels itself pure, so that it soars, or moves To mount aloft, and such a cry attends it. Of purity the will alone gives proof, Which, being wholly free to change its convent, Takes by surprise the soul, and helps it fly. First it wills well; but the desire permits not, Which divine justice with the self-same will There was to sin, upon the torment sets. And I, who have been lying in this pain Five hundred years and more, but just now felt A free volition for a better seat. Therefore thou heardst the earthquake, and the pious 232 \nSpirits along the mountain rendering praise Unto the Lord, that soon he speed them upwards.\" So said he to him; and since we enjoy As much in drinking as the thirst is great, I could not say how much it did me good. And the wise Leader: \"Now I see the net That snares you here, and how ye are set free, Why the earth quakes, and wherefore ye rejoice. Now who thou wast be pleased that I may know; And why so many centuries thou hast here Been lying, let me gather from thy words.\" \"In days when the good Titus, with the aid Of the supremest King, avenged the wounds Whence issued forth the blood by Judas sold, Under the name that most endures and honours, Was I on earth,\" that spirit made reply, \"Greatly renowned, but not with faith as yet. My vocal spirit was so sweet, that Rome Me, a Thoulousian, drew unto herself, Where I deserved to deck my brows with myrtle. Statius the people name me still on earth; I sang of Thebes, and then of great Achilles; But on the way fell with my second burden. The seeds unto my ardour were the sparks Of that celestial flame which heated me, Whereby more than a thousand have been fired; Of the Aeneid speak I, which to me A mother was, and was my nurse in song; Without this weighed I not a drachma's weight. And to have lived upon the earth what time Virgilius lived, I would accept one sun More than I must ere issuing from my ban.\" These words towards me made Virgilius turn With looks that in their silence said, \"Be silent!\" But yet the power that wills cannot do all things; For tears and laughter are such pursuivants Unto the passion from which each springs forth, In the most truthful least the will they follow. I only smiled, as one who gives the wink; Whereat the shade was silent, and it gazed 233 \nInto mine eyes, where most expression dwells; And, \"As thou well mayst consummate a labour So great,\" it said, \"why did thy face just now Display to me the lightning of a smile?\" Now am I caught on this side and on that; One keeps me silent, one to speak conjures me, Wherefore I sigh, and I am understood. \"Speak,\" said my Master, \"and be not afraid Of speaking, but speak out, and say to him What he demands with such solicitude.\" Whence I: \"Thou peradventure marvellest, O antique spirit, at the smile I gave; But I will have more wonder seize upon thee. This one, who guides on high these eyes of mine, Is that Virgilius, from whom thou didst learn To sing aloud of men and of the Gods. If other cause thou to my smile imputedst, Abandon it as false, and trust it was Those words which thou hast spoken concerning him.\" Already he was stooping to embrace My Teacher's feet; but he said to him: \"Brother, Do not; for shade thou art, and shade beholdest.\" And he uprising: \"Now canst thou the sum Of love which warms me to thee comprehend, When this our vanity I disremember, Treating a shadow as substantial thing.\" 234",
      "modern": "The natural thirst that can never be satisfied\nexcept by the water for which\nthe Samaritan woman pleaded\ntormented me.\n\nThe path was rough and steep, and urgency drove me forward\nbehind my guide as I pitied the souls receiving their righteous punishment.\nThen—just as Luke tells us Christ appeared\nto two disciples on the road from his empty tomb—\na spirit materialized behind us, gazing down\nat the prostrate multitude. We hadn't noticed him\nuntil he spoke: \"My brothers, may God grant you peace!\"\n\nWe spun around, and Virgil offered\nthe proper greeting in return.\nThe spirit began: \"May the true court of heaven\nseat you in peace among the blessed—\nthat same court that banishes me to eternal exile!\"\n\n\"Wait,\" he said as we continued climbing swiftly,\n\"if you're souls that God refuses to lift up,\nwho has guided you so far up his mountain?\"\n\nMy teacher answered: \"If you look at the marks\nthis one bears, traced by the angel's hand,\nyou'll see he's destined to reign with the righteous.\nBut since she who spins day and night\nhasn't yet finished winding the thread of life\nthat Clotho sets and measures for each soul,\nhis spirit—sister to yours and mine—\ncouldn't make this journey alone,\nbecause it doesn't see as we do.\nSo I was drawn from hell's vast throat\nto be his guide, and I'll lead him\nas far as my knowledge can take him.\n\nBut tell us, if you know—why did the mountain\nshudder just now? Why did every voice\ncry out together, down to its very base?\"\n\nHis question struck the bull's-eye of my curiosity,\nand hope alone began to ease my thirst for answers.\n\n\"Nothing happens here,\" he began, \"that breaks\nthe sacred order of this mountain,\nnothing foreign to its customs.\nThis place is free from all earthly change.\nOnly what heaven draws from itself\ncan affect what happens here—nothing else.\nNo rain falls here, no hail, no snow,\nno dew, no frost—nothing higher\nthan those three short steps below us.\nNo thick clouds appear, no thin ones,\nno lightning, no rainbow\nthat shifts its colors across earthly skies.\nNo dry vapor rises any higher\nthan the top of those three steps I mentioned,\nwhere Peter's representative plants his feet.\nLower down the mountain may tremble more or less,\nbut up here it never shakes from wind\nhidden in the earth—I don't know how that works.\n\nThe mountain trembles only when a soul\nfeels itself pure enough to rise,\nto begin climbing higher—and that cry accompanies it.\nThe will alone proves this purity.\nWhen completely free to change its dwelling,\nit surprises the soul and helps it soar.\nThe soul wants to do good at first, but desire won't let it—\nthe same desire that divine justice,\nmatching the soul's will to sin, sets upon torment.\nI've been lying in this pain\nfor five hundred years and more, but just now felt\nmy will become free to seek a higher place.\nThat's why you heard the earthquake and the faithful\nspirits throughout the mountain giving praise\nto the Lord, praying he'll speed them upward.\"\n\nSo he explained. Since we enjoy drinking\nas much as our thirst is great,\nI can't say how much good his words did me.\n\nMy wise leader said: \"Now I see the net\nthat traps you here, and how you break free,\nwhy the earth shakes, and why you rejoice.\nPlease let me know who you were,\nand why you've lain here so many centuries—\nlet me gather this from your own words.\"\n\n\"In the days when good Titus, with help\nfrom the highest King, avenged the wounds\nthat bled the blood Judas sold,\nI lived on earth,\" that spirit replied,\n\"under the name that lasts longest and brings most honor.\nI was famous then, but not yet faithful.\nMy voice was so sweet that Rome\ndrew me, a man from Toulouse, to herself,\nwhere I earned the right to crown my brow with myrtle.\nPeople on earth still call me Statius.\nI sang of Thebes, then of great Achilles,\nbut fell along the way with my second burden.\nThe sparks that kindled my passion\ncame from that divine flame that warmed more\nthan a thousand others—I mean the Aeneid,\nwhich was my mother and nurse in poetry.\nWithout it I would have achieved nothing.\nTo have lived on earth in Virgil's time,\nI'd accept one more year of exile\nbefore emerging from this punishment.\"\n\nThese words made Virgil turn toward me\nwith a look that silently said: \"Stay quiet!\"\nBut the will can't control everything—\ntears and laughter follow so closely\nthe emotions that produce them\nthat they least obey the will in the most honest people.\nI only smiled, like someone giving a hint,\nand the shade fell silent, staring\ninto my eyes, where expression lives most fully.\n\n\"So that you may complete such great work,\" he said,\n\"why did your face just flash a smile at me?\"\n\nNow I'm caught between two commands:\none tells me to stay silent, one urges me to speak,\nso I sigh, and my master understands.\n\"Speak,\" he said, \"don't be afraid\nto talk, but tell him openly\nwhat he asks so eagerly.\"\n\nSo I answered: \"Ancient spirit, you may wonder\nat the smile I gave, but let me\nfill you with even greater wonder.\nThis one who guides my eyes toward heaven\nis that very Virgil from whom you learned\nto sing of mortals and gods.\nIf you thought my smile had some other cause,\ndismiss it as false—it came from those words\nyou spoke about him.\"\n\nThe spirit was already bending down to embrace\nmy teacher's feet, but Virgil said: \"Brother,\ndon't—you're a shade, and you see a shade.\"\n\nRising, Statius replied: \"Now you can understand\nthe measure of love that warms me toward you,\nwhen I forget our insubstantial nature\nand treat a shadow as something solid.\"",

      "original": "Already was the Angel left behind us, The Angel who to the sixth round had turned us, Having erased one mark from off my face; And those who have in justice their desire Had said to us, \"Beati,\" in their voices, With \"sitio,\" and without more ended it. And I, more light than through the other passes, Went onward so, that without any labour I followed upward the swift-footed spirits; When thus Virgilius began: \"The love Kindled by virtue aye another kindles, Provided outwardly its flame appear. Hence from the hour that Juvenal descended Among us into the infernal Limbo, Who made apparent to me thy affection, My kindliness towards thee was as great As ever bound one to an unseen person, So that these stairs will now seem short to me. But tell me, and forgive me as a friend, If too great confidence let loose the rein, And as a friend now hold discourse with me; How was it possible within thy breast For avarice to find place, 'mid so much wisdom As thou wast filled with by thy diligence?\" These words excited Statius at first Somewhat to laughter; afterward he answered: \"Each word of thine is love's dear sign to me. Verily oftentimes do things appear Which give fallacious matter to our doubts, 235 Instead of the true causes which are hidden! Thy question shows me thy belief to be That I was niggard in the other life, It may be from the circle where I was; Therefore know thou, that avarice was removed Too far from me; and this extravagance Thousands of lunar periods have punished. And were it not that I my thoughts uplifted, When I the passage heard where thou exclaimest, As if indignant, unto human nature, 'To what impellest thou not, O cursed hunger Of gold, the appetite of mortal men?' Revolving I should feel the dismal joustings. Then I perceived the hands could spread too wide Their wings in spending, and repented me As well of that as of my other sins; How many with shorn hair shall rise again Because of ignorance, which from this sin Cuts off repentance living and in death! And know that the transgression which rebuts By direct opposition any sin Together with it here its verdure dries. Therefore if I have been among that folk Which mourns its avarice, to purify me, For its opposite has this befallen me.\" \"Now when thou sangest the relentless weapons Of the twofold affliction of Jocasta,\" The singer of the Songs Bucolic said, \"From that which Clio there with thee preludes, It does not seem that yet had made thee faithful That faith without which no good works suffice. If this be so, what candles or what sun Scattered thy darkness so that thou didst trim Thy sails behind the Fisherman thereafter?\" And he to him: \"Thou first directedst me Towards Parnassus, in its grots to drink, And first concerning God didst me enlighten. Thou didst as he who walketh in the night, Who bears his light behind, which helps him not, But wary makes the persons after him, 236 \nWhen thou didst say: 'The age renews itself, Justice returns, and man's primeval time, And a new progeny descends from heaven.' Through thee I Poet was, through thee a Christian; But that thou better see what I design, To colour it will I extend my hand. Already was the world in every part Pregnant with the true creed, disseminated By messengers of the eternal kingdom; And thy assertion, spoken of above, With the new preachers was in unison; Whence I to visit them the custom took. Then they became so holy in my sight, That, when Domitian persecuted them, Not without tears of mine were their laments; And all the while that I on earth remained, Them I befriended, and their upright customs Made me disparage all the other sects. And ere I led the Greeks unto the rivers Of Thebes, in poetry, I was baptized, But out of fear was covertly a Christian, For a long time professing paganism; And this lukewarmness caused me the fourth circle To circuit round more than four centuries. Thou, therefore, who hast raised the covering That hid from me whatever good I speak of, While in ascending we have time to spare, Tell me, in what place is our friend Terentius, Caecilius, Plautus, Varro, if thou knowest; Tell me if they are damned, and in what alley.\" \"These, Persius and myself, and others many,\" Replied my Leader, \"with that Grecian are Whom more than all the rest the Muses suckled, In the first circle of the prison blind; Ofttimes we of the mountain hold discourse Which has our nurses ever with itself. Euripides is with us, Antiphon, Simonides, Agatho, and many other Greeks who of old their brows with laurel decked. There some of thine own people may be seen, 237 \nAntigone, Deiphile and Argia, And there Ismene mournful as of old. There she is seen who pointed out Langia; There is Tiresias' daughter, and there Thetis, And there Deidamia with her sisters.\" Silent already were the poets both, Attent once more in looking round about, From the ascent and from the walls released; And four handmaidens of the day already Were left behind, and at the pole the fifth Was pointing upward still its burning horn, What time my Guide: \"I think that tow'rds the edge Our dexter shoulders it behoves us turn, Circling the mount as we are wont to do.\" Thus in that region custom was our ensign; And we resumed our way with less suspicion For the assenting of that worthy soul They in advance went on, and I alone Behind them, and I listened to their speech, Which gave me lessons in the art of song. But soon their sweet discourses interrupted A tree which midway in the road we found, With apples sweet and grateful to the smell. And even as a fir-tree tapers upward From bough to bough, so downwardly did that; I think in order that no one might climb it. On that side where our pathway was enclosed Fell from the lofty rock a limpid water, And spread itself abroad upon the leaves. The Poets twain unto the tree drew near, And from among the foliage a voice Cried: \"Of this food ye shall have scarcity.\" Then said: \"More thoughtful Mary was of making The marriage feast complete and honourable, Than of her mouth which now for you responds; And for their drink the ancient Roman women With water were content; and Daniel Disparaged food, and understanding won. The primal age was beautiful as gold; Acorns it made with hunger savorous, 238 \nAnd nectar every rivulet with thirst. Honey and locusts were the aliments That fed the Baptist in the wilderness; Whence he is glorious, and so magnified As by the Evangel is revealed to you.\" 239",
      "modern": "We had already left the Angel behind us,\nthe one who had turned us toward the sixth terrace,\nhaving erased\n\nI wiped the last mark from my face, and those souls\nwhose deepest longing was for justice spoke to us—\ntheir voices crying \"Blessed are they\" then ending\nabruptly with \"who thirst,\" saying nothing more.\n\nAnd I, made lighter than in the passes before,\nmoved onward with such ease that without effort\nI followed the swift spirits climbing upward.\n\nThen Virgil began: \"Love kindled by virtue\nalways kindles love in another heart,\nas long as its flame shows itself outwardly.\nFrom the moment Juvenal descended\nto join us in the infernal Limbo\nand revealed to me your deep affection,\nmy goodwill toward you grew as strong\nas any bond between souls who've never met—\nso strong that these stairs now seem short to me.\n\nBut tell me, and forgive me as a friend\nif too much trust loosens my tongue,\nspeak to me now as friend to friend:\nhow could avarice find room in your heart\nalongside all the wisdom you possessed,\nearned through such careful study?\"\n\nThese words made Statius laugh at first,\nthen he answered: \"Every word you speak\nis a precious sign of love to me.\nTruly, things often appear to us\nin ways that breed false doubts,\nhiding the real causes underneath.\n\nYour question tells me you believe\nI was miserly in my former life,\nperhaps from seeing which circle held me.\nKnow this: avarice was banished\nfar from me—this excess, this opposite sin,\nthousands of months have punished here.\n\nHad I not lifted up my thoughts\nwhen I heard that passage where you cry out,\nas if enraged at human nature:\n'Cursed hunger for gold, to what extremes\ndo you not drive the appetite of mortals?'—\nhad I not turned from my ways then,\nI would still be feeling those grim battles.\n\nThen I understood that hands could spread\ntheir wings too wide in spending, and I repented\nof that sin as much as all my others.\nHow many will rise again with cropped hair\nbecause of ignorance that cuts them off\nfrom repentance both in life and death!\n\nKnow that any sin which directly opposes\nanother sin withers here alongside it.\nSo if I was among that crowd\nthat mourns avarice, it was to purify me—\nthis punishment fell on me for its opposite.\"\n\n\"When you sang of the merciless weapons\nof Jocasta's double sorrow,\" the singer\nof pastoral songs replied, \"judging from what\nClio inspired you to write then,\nit doesn't seem that faith had made you faithful yet—\nthat faith without which good works mean nothing.\nIf this is true, what candles or what sun\nscattered your darkness so completely\nthat you trimmed your sails to follow the Fisherman?\"\n\nAnd Statius answered: \"You first directed me\ntoward Parnassus to drink from its caves,\nand you first gave me light concerning God.\nYou were like someone walking in the night\nwho carries his lamp behind him—\nit doesn't help him, but makes those who follow wary—\nwhen you said: 'The ages begin again,\njustice returns with humanity's first time,\nand a new generation descends from heaven.'\n\nThrough you I became a poet, through you a Christian.\nBut so you see more clearly what I mean,\nlet me extend my hand to fill in the colors.\n\nAlready the world in every part\nwas pregnant with the true faith,\nspread by messengers of the eternal kingdom.\nYour words that I quoted above\nharmonized with these new preachers,\nso I made it my custom to seek them out.\n\nThey grew so holy in my sight\nthat when Domitian persecuted them,\nmy tears flowed with their laments.\nAll the time I remained on earth\nI helped them, and their righteous ways\nmade me scorn all other sects.\n\nBefore I led the Greeks to Thebes' rivers\nin my poetry, I had been baptized—\nbut out of fear remained secretly Christian,\nlong pretending to be pagan still.\nThis lukewarm faith made me circle\nthe fourth terrace for more than four hundred years.\n\nYou who have lifted the veil\nthat hid from me the good I now speak of—\nwhile we still have time as we climb—\ntell me where our Terence is now,\nCaecilius, Plautus, Varro, if you know.\nTell me if they're damned, and in what district.\"\n\n\"These poets, and Persius, and myself, and many others,\"\nmy guide replied, \"dwell with that Greek\nwhom the Muses nursed above all others,\nin the first circle of the sightless prison.\nWe often speak of the mountain\nthat forever holds our nurses with itself.\nEuripides is with us, Antiphon,\nSimonides, Agathon, and many other Greeks\nwho once crowned their brows with laurel.\n\nThere you can see some of your own characters—\nAntigone, Deiphyle, and Argia,\nIsmene still as sorrowful as ever.\nThere is she who showed Langia's spring,\nthere Tiresias' daughter, there Thetis,\nand Deidamia with her sisters.\"\n\nBoth poets fell silent now,\nintent once more on looking all around,\nfree from the climb and from the walls.\nFour handmaidens of the day\nhad already been left behind,\nand the fifth was pointing upward\nits burning horn at the pole,\nwhen my guide said: \"I think we should turn\nour right shoulders toward the edge,\ncircling the mountain as we usually do.\"\n\nSo custom served as our banner there,\nand we resumed our path with less uncertainty,\nencouraged by that worthy soul's agreement.\n\nThey walked ahead, and I alone behind them,\nlistening to their conversation\nwhich taught me lessons in the art of poetry.\nBut soon their sweet discourse was interrupted\nby a tree we found blocking our path,\nheavy with apples sweet and fragrant.\n\nAs a fir tree tapers upward\nfrom branch to branch, this tree tapered downward—\nI think so that no one could climb it.\nOn the side where our path was enclosed,\nclear water fell from the high rock\nand spread itself across the leaves.\n\nThe two poets approached the tree,\nand from within the foliage a voice cried:\n\"You shall be denied this food.\"\n\nThen it said: \"Mary cared more about making\nthe wedding feast complete and honorable\nthan about her own mouth, which now speaks for you.\nThe ancient Roman women were content\nwith water for their drink, and Daniel\nscorned food and gained understanding.\n\nThe first age was beautiful as gold—\nhunger made acorns taste delicious,\nand thirst made every stream like nectar.\nHoney and locusts were the only food\nthat nourished the Baptist in the wilderness,\nwhich is why he is glorious and magnified\nas the Gospel reveals to you.\"",

      "original": "The while among the verdant leaves mine eyes I riveted, as he is wont to do Who wastes his life pursuing little birds, My more than Father said unto me: \"Son, Come now; because the time that is ordained us More usefully should be apportioned out.\" I turned my face and no less soon my steps Unto the Sages, who were speaking so They made the going of no cost to me; And lo! were heard a song and a lament, \"Labia mea, Domine,\" in fashion Such that delight and dolence it brought forth. \"O my sweet Father, what is this I hear?\" Began I; and he answered: \"Shades that go Perhaps the knot unloosing of their debt.\" In the same way that thoughtful pilgrims do, Who, unknown people on the road o'ertaking, Turn themselves round to them, and do not stop, Even thus, behind us with a swifter motion Coming and passing onward, gazed upon us A crowd of spirits silent and devout. Each in his eyes was dark and cavernous, Pallid in face, and so emaciate That from the bones the skin did shape itself. I do not think that so to merest rind Could Erisichthon have been withered up By famine, when most fear he had of it. Thinking within myself I said: \"Behold, This is the folk who lost Jerusalem, When Mary made a prey of her own son.\" 240 Their sockets were like rings without the gems; Whoever in the face of men reads 'omo' Might well in these have recognised the 'm.' Who would believe the odour of an apple, Begetting longing, could consume them so, And that of water, without knowing how? I still was wondering what so famished them, For the occasion not yet manifest Of their emaciation and sad squalor; And lo! from out the hollow of his head His eyes a shade turned on me, and looked keenly; Then cried aloud: \"What grace to me is this?\" Never should I have known him by his look; But in his voice was evident to me That which his aspect had suppressed within it. This spark within me wholly re-enkindled My recognition of his altered face, And I recalled the features of Forese. \"Ah, do not look at this dry leprosy,\" Entreated he, \"which doth my skin discolour, Nor at default of flesh that I may have; But tell me truth of thee, and who are those Two souls, that yonder make for thee an escort; Do not delay in speaking unto me.\" \"That face of thine, which dead I once bewept, Gives me for weeping now no lesser grief,\" I answered him, \"beholding it so changed! But tell me, for God's sake, what thus denudes you? Make me not speak while I am marvelling, For ill speaks he who's full of other longings.\" And he to me: \"From the eternal council Falls power into the water and the tree Behind us left, whereby I grow so thin. All of this people who lamenting sing, For following beyond measure appetite In hunger and thirst are here re-sanctified. Desire to eat and drink enkindles in us The scent that issues from the apple-tree, And from the spray that sprinkles o'er the verdure; And not a single time alone, this ground 241 \nEncompassing, is refreshed our pain,— I say our pain, and ought to say our solace,— For the same wish doth lead us to the tree Which led the Christ rejoicing to say 'Eli,' When with his veins he liberated us.\" And I to him: \"Forese, from that day When for a better life thou changedst worlds, Up to this time five years have not rolled round. If sooner were the power exhausted in thee Of sinning more, than thee the hour surprised Of that good sorrow which to God reweds us, How hast thou come up hitherward already? I thought to find thee down there underneath, Where time for time doth restitution make.\" And he to me: \"Thus speedily has led me To drink of the sweet wormwood of these torments, My Nella with her overflowing tears; She with her prayers devout and with her sighs Has drawn me from the coast where one where one awaits, And from the other circles set me free. So much more dear and pleasing is to God My little widow, whom so much I loved, As in good works she is the more alone; For the Barbagia of Sardinia By far more modest in its women is Than the Barbagia I have left her in. O brother sweet, what wilt thou have me say? A future time is in my sight already, To which this hour will not be very old, When from the pulpit shall be interdicted To the unblushing womankind of Florence To go about displaying breast and paps. What savages were e'er, what Saracens, Who stood in need, to make them covered go, Of spiritual or other discipline? But if the shameless women were assured Of what swift Heaven prepares for them, already Wide open would they have their mouths to howl; For if my foresight here deceive me not, They shall be sad ere he has bearded cheeks 242 \nWho now is hushed to sleep with lullaby. O brother, now no longer hide thee from me; See that not only I, but all these people Are gazing there, where thou dost veil the sun.\" Whence I to him: \"If thou bring back to mind What thou with me hast been and I with thee, The present memory will be grievous still. Out of that life he turned me back who goes In front of me, two days agone when round The sister of him yonder showed herself,\" And to the sun I pointed. \"Through the deep Night of the truly dead has this one led me, With this true flesh, that follows after him. Thence his encouragements have led me up, Ascending and still circling round the mount That you doth straighten, whom the world made crooked. He says that he will bear me company, Till I shall be where Beatrice will be; There it behoves me to remain without him. This is Virgilius, who thus says to me,\" And him I pointed at; \"the other is That shade for whom just now shook every slope Your realm, that from itself discharges him.\" 243",
      "modern": "While I fixed my eyes\namong the green leaves,\n\nLike a man who wastes his life chasing after small birds,\nmy more-than-father said to me: \"Son,\ncome now—the time that has been given to us\nshould be put to better use.\"\n\nI turned my face and just as quickly my steps\ntoward the wise guides, who spoke in such a way\nthat walking became effortless for me.\n\nAnd then we heard singing mixed with lamentation:\n\"Labia mea, Domine\"—\"Open my lips, O Lord\"—\nsung in a way that brought both joy and sorrow.\n\n\"O my dear father, what is this I hear?\"\nI began, and he answered: \"These are souls\nperhaps loosening the knots of their debt.\"\n\nThe way thoughtful pilgrims do\nwhen they overtake strangers on the road—\nthey turn to look but do not stop—\n\njust so, moving faster than us,\ncoming from behind and passing onward,\na crowd of spirits gazed at us, silent and devout.\n\nEach had eyes dark and sunken,\nfaces pale, so wasted away\nthat skin took its shape from bone alone.\n\nI don't think even Erysichthon\ncould have been withered to such a husk\nby famine, even when he feared it most.\n\nThinking to myself I said: \"Look—\nthese are the people who lost Jerusalem\nwhen Mary made prey of her own son.\"\n\nTheir eye sockets were like rings without gems.\nWhoever reads 'omo' in the human face\ncould clearly recognize the 'm' in theirs.\n\nWho would believe that the scent of an apple\ncould consume them so with longing,\nor the smell of water—and they don't know why?\n\nI was still wondering what starved them so,\nthe reason not yet clear to me\nfor their emaciation and wretched squalor,\n\nwhen suddenly from the hollow of his skull\na shade turned his eyes on me and stared intently,\nthen cried out: \"What grace is this for me?\"\n\nI never would have known him by his looks,\nbut in his voice I clearly heard\nwhat his appearance had hidden within.\n\nThis spark completely rekindled in me\nrecognition of his transformed face,\nand I recalled the features of Forese.\n\n\"Please, don't stare at this dry leprosy\nthat discolors my skin,\" he pleaded,\n\"or at whatever flesh I might be lacking.\n\nBut tell me the truth about yourself—who are those\ntwo souls who escort you over there?\nDon't delay in speaking to me!\"\n\n\"Your face, which I wept over when you died,\ngives me no less cause for weeping now,\"\nI answered, \"seeing it so changed.\n\nBut tell me, for God's sake, what strips you bare like this?\nDon't make me speak while I'm still marveling—\nhe speaks poorly who's full of other longings.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"From the eternal council\npower flows into the water and the tree\nwe left behind us, by which I grow so thin.\n\nAll these people who sing lamenting here,\nfor following appetite beyond all measure,\nare re-sanctified in hunger and thirst.\n\nThe desire to eat and drink kindles in us\nfrom the scent rising from the apple tree\nand from the spray that waters the green leaves.\n\nAnd not just once, as we circle this ledge,\nour pain is refreshed—I say pain\nbut should say solace—\n\nfor the same longing leads us to the tree\nthat led Christ to cry 'Eli' in joy\nwhen with his blood he set us free.\"\n\nAnd I to him: \"Forese, from that day\nwhen you left this world for a better life\nnot even five years have passed.\n\nIf your power to sin was exhausted\nbefore the hour of good sorrow surprised you—\nthat sorrow which reweds us to God—\n\nhow have you climbed up here already?\nI thought I'd find you down below,\nwhere time makes restitution for time.\"\n\nAnd he to me: \"My Nella has led me\nso quickly to drink the sweet wormwood\nof these torments, with her flooding tears.\n\nWith her devout prayers and her sighs\nshe has drawn me from the shore where souls wait\nand freed me from the other circles.\n\nMy little widow, whom I loved so much,\nis all the more dear and pleasing to God\nas she stands more alone in good works.\n\nFor the women of Sardinia's Barbagia\nare far more modest\nthan those of the Barbagia I left her in.\n\nO sweet brother, what would you have me say?\nI can already see a future time,\nnot very far from this present hour,\n\nwhen from the pulpit it will be forbidden\nfor Florence's shameless womankind\nto walk around displaying breast and nipple.\n\nWhat barbarians ever, what Saracens,\nneeded spiritual discipline or other punishment\nto make them go about covered?\n\nBut if those shameless women were assured\nof what swift Heaven prepares for them,\ntheir mouths would already be wide open, howling.\n\nFor if my foresight here does not deceive me,\nthey will be grieving before the cheeks grow bearded\nof him who now is hushed to sleep with lullabies.\n\nO brother, hide from me no longer—\nsee that not only I, but all these people\nare staring at the place where you block the sun.\"\n\nSo I said to him: \"If you bring back to mind\nwhat you were with me and I with you,\nthe present memory will still be painful.\n\nHe who walks in front of me turned me back\nfrom that life, two days ago, when round\nthe sister of the one over there showed herself full.\"\n\nAnd I pointed to the sun. \"Through the deep night\nof the truly dead, this one has led me\nwith this real flesh that follows him.\n\nFrom there his encouragements have led me upward,\nclimbing and circling around the mountain\nthat straightens you, whom the world made crooked.\n\nHe says he will keep me company\nuntil I reach where Beatrice will be—\nthere I must remain without him.\n\nThis is Virgil, who tells me this,\"\nand I pointed to him, \"and that other is the shade\nfor whom just now every slope shook throughout\n\nyour realm, as it releases him from itself.\"",

      "original": "In- quiry into the State of Poetry. Nor speech the going, nor the going that Slackened; but talking we went bravely on, Even as a vessel urged by a good wind. And shadows, that appeared things doubly dead, From out the sepulchres of their eyes betrayed Wonder at me, aware that I was living. And I, continuing my colloquy, Said: \"Peradventure he goes up more slowly Than he would do, for other people's sake. But tell me, if thou knowest, where is Piccarda; Tell me if any one of note I see Among this folk that gazes at me so.\" \"My sister, who, 'twixt beautiful and good, I know not which was more, triumphs rejoicing Already in her crown on high Olympus.\" So said he first, and then: \"'Tis not forbidden To name each other here, so milked away Is our resemblance by our dieting. This,\" pointing with his finger, \"is Buonagiunta, Buonagiunta, of Lucca; and that face Beyond him there, more peaked than the others, Has held the holy Church within his arms; From Tours was he, and purges by his fasting Bolsena's eels and the Vernaccia wine.\" He named me many others one by one; And all contented seemed at being named, So that for this I saw not one dark look. I saw for hunger bite the empty air Ubaldin dalla Pila, and Boniface, 244 Who with his crook had pastured many people. I saw Messer Marchese, who had leisure Once at Forli for drinking with less dryness, And he was one who ne'er felt satisfied. But as he does who scans, and then doth prize One more than others, did I him of Lucca, Who seemed to take most cognizance of me. He murmured, and I know not what Gentucca From that place heard I, where he felt the wound Of justice, that doth macerate them so. \"O soul,\" I said, \"that seemest so desirous To speak with me, do so that I may hear thee, And with thy speech appease thyself and me.\" \"A maid is born, and wears not yet the veil,\" Began he, \"who to thee shall pleasant make My city, howsoever men may blame it. Thou shalt go on thy way with this prevision; If by my murmuring thou hast been deceived, True things hereafter will declare it to thee. But say if him I here behold, who forth Evoked the new-invented rhymes, beginning, 'Ladies, that have intelligence of love?'\" And I to him: \"One am I, who, whenever Love doth inspire me, note, and in that measure Which he within me dictates, singing go.\" \"O brother, now I see,\" he said, \"the knot Which me, the Notary, and Guittone held Short of the sweet new style that now I hear. I do perceive full clearly how your pens Go closely following after him who dictates, Which with our own forsooth came not to pass; And he who sets himself to go beyond, No difference sees from one style to another;\" And as if satisfied, he held his peace. Even as the birds, that winter tow'rds the Nile, Sometimes into a phalanx form themselves, Then fly in greater haste, and go in file; In such wise all the people who were there, Turning their faces, hurried on their steps, Both by their leanness and their wishes light. 245 \nAnd as a man, who weary is with trotting, Lets his companions onward go, and walks, Until he vents the panting of his chest; So did Forese let the holy flock Pass by, and came with me behind it, saying, \"When will it be that I again shall see thee?\" \"How long,\" I answered, \"I may live, I know not; Yet my return will not so speedy be, But I shall sooner in desire arrive; Because the place where I was set to live From day to day of good is more depleted, And unto dismal ruin seems ordained.\" \"Now go,\" he said, \"for him most guilty of it At a beast's tail behold I dragged along Towards the valley where is no repentance. Faster at every step the beast is going, Increasing evermore until it smites him, And leaves the body vilely mutilated. Not long those wheels shall turn,\" and he uplifted His eyes to heaven, \"ere shall be clear to thee That which my speech no farther can declare. Now stay behind; because the time so precious Is in this kingdom, that I lose too much By coming onward thus abreast with thee.\" As sometimes issues forth upon a gallop A cavalier from out a troop that ride, And seeks the honour of the first encounter, So he with greater strides departed from us; And on the road remained I with those two, Who were such mighty marshals of the world. And when before us he had gone so far Mine eyes became to him such pursuivants As was my understanding to his words, Appeared to me with laden and living boughs Another apple-tree, and not far distant, From having but just then turned thitherward. People I saw beneath it lift their hands, And cry I know not what towards the leaves, Like little children eager and deluded, Who pray, and he they pray to doth not answer, 246 \nBut, to make very keen their appetite, Holds their desire aloft, and hides it not. Then they departed as if undeceived; And now we came unto the mighty tree Which prayers and tears so manifold refuses. \"Pass farther onward without drawing near; The tree of which Eve ate is higher up, And out of that one has this tree been raised.\" Thus said I know not who among the branches; Whereat Virgilius, Statius, and myself Went crowding forward on the side that rises. \"Be mindful,\" said he, \"of the accursed ones Formed of the cloud-rack, who inebriate Combated Theseus with their double breasts; And of the Jews who showed them soft in drinking, Whence Gideon would not have them for companions When he tow'rds Midian the hills descended.\" Thus, closely pressed to one of the two borders, On passed we, hearing sins of gluttony, Followed forsooth by miserable gains; Then set at large upon the lonely road, A thousand steps and more we onward went, In contemplation, each without a word. \"What go ye thinking thus, ye three alone?\" Said suddenly a voice, whereat I started As terrified and timid beasts are wont. I raised my head to see who this might be, And never in a furnace was there seen Metals or glass so lucent and so red As one I saw who said: \"If it may please you To mount aloft, here it behoves you turn; This way goes he who goeth after peace.\" His aspect had bereft me of my sight, So that I turned me back unto my Teachers, Like one who goeth as his hearing guides him. And as, the harbinger of early dawn, The air of May doth move and breathe out fragrance, Impregnate all with herbage and with flowers, So did I feel a breeze strike in the midst My front, and felt the moving of the plumes 247 \nThat breathed around an odour of ambrosia; And heard it said: \"Blessed are they whom grace So much illumines, that the love of taste Excites not in their breasts too great desire, Hungering at all times so far as is just.\" 248",
      "modern": "Our conversation didn't slow our steps—\nwe pressed forward boldly, talking as we walked,\nlike a ship driven by favorable winds.\n\nThe shadows, appearing doubly dead,\nrevealed wonder in the sepulchers of their eyes,\namazed to discover I was still alive.\n\nContinuing our exchange, I said:\n\"Perhaps he climbs more slowly than he might,\nfor the sake of others here.\nBut tell me, if you know—where is Piccarda?\nAnd do I see anyone of note\namong these souls who stare at me so intently?\"\n\n\"My sister—between beauty and goodness,\nI cannot say which was greater—\nalready triumphs, crowned and rejoicing\non high Olympus,\" he said first, then added:\n\"Here we're allowed to name each other freely,\nour faces so transformed by this strict diet.\n\nThis one,\" he said, pointing, \"is Buonaguinta\nof Lucca. That face beyond him,\nmore gaunt than all the rest,\nonce held the Holy Church in his embrace—\nhe came from Tours, and purges himself by fasting\nfrom Bolsena's eels and Vernaccia wine.\"\n\nHe named many others, one by one.\nAll seemed content to hear their names spoken—\nI saw not one darkened expression among them.\n\nI watched Ubaldino dalla Pila\nbite at empty air from hunger,\nand Boniface, who shepherded so many\nwith his bishop's staff.\n\nI saw Master Marchese, who once had leisure\nto drink at Forlì with less restraint than here,\nyet never felt truly satisfied.\n\nBut like someone who observes carefully\nthen values one above the others,\nI focused on the man from Lucca,\nwho seemed most eager to know me.\n\nHe murmured something—I caught the name \"Gentucca\"\nfrom that place where he feels justice's wound\nthat wastes them all so terribly.\n\n\"O soul,\" I said, \"you seem so eager\nto speak with me—do so that I might hear you\nand satisfy us both with conversation.\"\n\n\"A woman is born who does not yet wear the veil,\"\nhe began, \"who will make my city\npleasant to you, however others may condemn it.\nYou will continue your journey with this prophecy.\nIf my murmuring has misled you,\nfuture events will prove my words true.\n\nBut tell me—do I see him here who created\nthose revolutionary verses beginning:\n'Ladies who have intelligence of love'?\"\n\n\"I am one who, when Love inspires me,\npays attention, and expresses exactly\nwhat he dictates within me,\" I replied.\n\n\"O brother, now I understand,\" he said,\n\"the limitation that held me, the Notary, and Guittone\nback from that sweet new style I now hear.\nI see clearly how your pens\nfollow closely behind the one who dictates,\nwhich never happened with ours.\nWhoever tries to look beyond this difference\nsees no distinction between one style and another.\"\nSatisfied, he fell silent.\n\nLike birds wintering toward the Nile—\nsometimes forming into tight formations,\nthen flying faster in single file—\nall the people there turned their faces\nand quickened their steps,\nmade swift by both their leanness and their longing.\n\nAs a weary runner lets his companions\ncontinue ahead while he walks,\nventing the gasping from his chest,\nso Forese let the holy flock pass by\nand walked behind with me, asking:\n\"When will I see you again?\"\n\n\"I don't know how long I'll live,\" I answered,\n\"but my return won't be so swift\nthat desire won't arrive here first.\nThe place where I was born to live\ngrows more depleted of goodness each day\nand seems destined for terrible ruin.\"\n\n\"Go now,\" he said, \"for I see the one\nmost guilty of this being dragged\nby a beast's tail toward the valley\nwhere there is no repentance.\nThe beast runs faster with each step,\naccelerating until it strikes him down\nand leaves his body shamefully torn.\nThose wheels won't turn much longer\"—\nhe lifted his eyes toward heaven—\n\"before what my words cannot express\nbecomes clear to you.\n\nStay behind now, for time is so precious\nin this kingdom that I lose too much\nby walking alongside you like this.\"\n\nLike a knight breaking from a cavalry charge\nto seek the honor of first combat,\nhe departed from us with longer strides.\n\nI remained on the path with my two guides,\nsuch mighty marshals of the world.\nWhen he had gone so far ahead\nthat my eyes could barely follow him\nas my mind had struggled with his words,\n\nI saw the laden, living branches\nof another apple tree appear,\nnot far away, having just turned toward it.\n\nI saw people beneath it raising their hands,\ncrying out something toward the leaves—\nlike eager, deluded children\nwho beg from someone who doesn't answer\nbut holds their desire high and visible\nto sharpen their appetite.\n\nThen they departed as if undeceived.\nWe approached the great tree\nthat refuses so many prayers and tears.\n\n\"Pass onward without drawing near.\nHigher up stands the tree from which Eve ate—\nthis tree was raised from that one.\"\n\nSomeone among the branches spoke these words.\nVirgil, Statius, and I pressed forward\nalong the ascending side.\n\n\"Remember,\" the voice said, \"those accursed ones\nformed from clouds, who drunk with wine\nfought Theseus with their double chests.\nRemember the Jews who showed themselves soft\nin drinking, so Gideon refused them\nas companions descending toward Midian.\"\n\nPressed close to one edge of the path,\nwe passed on, hearing of gluttony's sins\nfollowed by their wretched consequences.\n\nReleased onto the empty road,\nwe continued more than a thousand steps forward\nin contemplation, each without a word.\n\n\"What are you three thinking as you walk alone?\"\na voice said suddenly.\nI started like a frightened, timid animal.\n\nI raised my head to see who spoke,\nand never in any furnace were metals or glass\nseen so brilliant and red\nas the figure who said: \"If you wish\nto ascend, you must turn here.\nThis is the way for one who seeks peace.\"\n\nHis radiance overwhelmed my sight,\nso I turned back to my teachers\nlike someone guided only by sound.\n\nAs the morning breeze of May\nmoves and breathes fragrance,\nsaturated with grass and flowers,\nI felt wind strike the center of my forehead\nand sensed the movement of feathers\nthat breathed an odor of ambrosia around me.\n\nAnd I heard these words:\n\"Blessed are those whom grace illuminates so fully\nthat love of taste never kindles excessive desire\nin their hearts, but leaves them hungering\nalways only as much as justice requires.\"",

      "original": "Now was it the ascent no hindrance brooked, Because the sun had his meridian circle To Taurus left, and night to Scorpio; Wherefore as doth a man who tarries not, But goes his way, whate'er to him appear, If of necessity the sting transfix him, In this wise did we enter through the gap, Taking the stairway, one before the other, Which by its narrowness divides the climbers. And as the little stork that lifts its wing With a desire to fly, and does not venture To leave the nest, and lets it downward droop, Even such was I, with the desire of asking Kindled and quenched, unto the motion coming He makes who doth address himself to speak. Not for our pace, though rapid it might be, My father sweet forbore, but said: \"Let fly The bow of speech thou to the barb hast drawn.\" With confidence I opened then my mouth, And I began: \"How can one meagre grow There where the need of nutriment applies not?\" \"If thou wouldst call to mind how Meleager Was wasted by the wasting of a brand, This would not,\" said he, \"be to thee so sour; And wouldst thou think how at each tremulous motion Trembles within a mirror your own image; That which seems hard would mellow seem to thee. But that thou mayst content thee in thy wish Lo Statius here; and him I call and pray 249 He now will be the healer of thy wounds.\" \"If I unfold to him the eternal vengeance,\" Responded Statius, \"where thou present art, Be my excuse that I can naught deny thee.\" Then he began: \"Son, if these words of mine Thy mind doth contemplate and doth receive, They'll be thy light unto the How thou sayest. The perfect blood, which never is drunk up Into the thirsty veins, and which remaineth Like food that from the table thou removest, Takes in the heart for all the human members Virtue informative, as being that Which to be changed to them goes through the veins Again digest, descends it where 'tis better Silent to be than say; and then drops thence Upon another's blood in natural vase. There one together with the other mingles, One to be passive meant, the other active By reason of the perfect place it springs from; And being conjoined, begins to operate, Coagulating first, then vivifying What for its matter it had made consistent. The active virtue, being made a soul As of a plant, (in so far different, This on the way is, that arrived already,) Then works so much, that now it moves and feels Like a sea-fungus, and then undertakes To organize the powers whose seed it is. Now, Son, dilates and now distends itself The virtue from the generator's heart, Where nature is intent on all the members. But how from animal it man becomes Thou dost not see as yet; this is a point Which made a wiser man than thou once err So far, that in his doctrine separate He made the soul from possible intellect, For he no organ saw by this assumed. Open thy breast unto the truth that's coming, And know that, just as soon as in the foetus The articulation of the brain is perfect, 250 \nThe primal Motor turns to it well pleased At so great art of nature, and inspires A spirit new with virtue all replete, Which what it finds there active doth attract Into its substance, and becomes one soul, Which lives, and feels, and on itself revolves. And that thou less may wonder at my word, Behold the sun's heat, which becometh wine, Joined to the juice that from the vine distils. Whenever Lachesis has no more thread, It separates from the flesh, and virtually Bears with itself the human and divine; The other faculties are voiceless all; The memory, the intelligence, and the will In action far more vigorous than before. Without a pause it falleth of itself In marvellous way on one shore or the other; There of its roads it first is cognizant. Soon as the place there circumscribeth it, The virtue informative rays round about, As, and as much as, in the living members. And even as the air, when full of rain, By alien rays that are therein reflected, With divers colours shows itself adorned, So there the neighbouring air doth shape itself Into that form which doth impress upon it Virtually the soul that has stood still. And then in manner of the little flame, Which followeth the fire where'er it shifts, After the spirit followeth its new form. Since afterwards it takes from this its semblance, It is called shade; and thence it organizes Thereafter every sense, even to the sight. Thence is it that we speak, and thence we laugh; Thence is it that we form the tears and sighs, That on the mountain thou mayhap hast heard. According as impress us our desires And other affections, so the shade is shaped, And this is cause of what thou wonderest at.\" And now unto the last of all the circles 251 \nHad we arrived, and to the right hand turned, And were attentive to another care. There the embankment shoots forth flames of fire, And upward doth the cornice breathe a blast That drives them back, and from itself sequesters. Hence we must needs go on the open side, And one by one; and I did fear the fire On this side, and on that the falling down. My Leader said: \"Along this place one ought To keep upon the eyes a tightened rein, Seeing that one so easily might err.\" \"Summae Deus clementiae,\" in the bosom Of the great burning chanted then I heard, Which made me no less eager to turn round; And spirits saw I walking through the flame; Wherefore I looked, to my own steps and theirs Apportioning my sight from time to time. After the close which to that hymn is made, Aloud they shouted, \"Virum non cognosco;\" Then recommenced the hymn with voices low. This also ended, cried they: \"To the wood Diana ran, and drove forth Helice Therefrom, who had of Venus felt the poison.\" Then to their song returned they; then the wives They shouted, and the husbands who were chaste. As virtue and the marriage vow imposes.

      "modern": "Now nothing could delay our upward climb—\nthe sun had left its midday circle in Taurus,\nand night had claimed Scorpio's domain.\n\nSo like a man who never hesitates\nbut walks his path no matter what appears,\nwhen necessity's sharp spur drives him forward,\nwe entered through that narrow cleft,\nclimbing the stairway single file,\nits tightness forcing climbers apart.\n\nAnd like a young stork lifting its wing\nwith longing to take flight, yet lacking courage\nto leave the nest, letting the wing fall back—\nso was I, with my desire to ask\nkindled then quenched, making those movements\nof one preparing to speak.\n\nDespite our rapid pace,\nmy gentle father did not hold back, but said:\n\"Release the arrow of speech\nyou've drawn back to the string.\"\n\nConfident now, I opened my mouth and began:\n\"How can someone grow thin\nwhere no need for food exists?\"\n\n\"If you remembered how Meleager\nwasted away as the burning brand consumed,\nthis wouldn't seem so bitter to you.\nAnd if you'd think how your own image\ntrembles in a mirror with each trembling motion,\nwhat seems hard would soften in understanding.\nBut so your wish might find fulfillment,\nhere stands Statius—I call on him and beg\nhe be the healer of your wounds.\"\n\n\"If I reveal eternal judgment to him\nwhile you are present,\" Statius replied,\n\"let my excuse be that I cannot refuse you.\"\n\nThen he began: \"Son, if your mind\ncontemplates and receives these words of mine,\nthey'll light the way to your 'How can this be?'\n\nPerfect blood, never absorbed\ninto those thirsty veins, remaining\nlike food you remove from the table,\nacquires in the heart, for all human limbs,\nthe power to give form—being that blood\nwhich flows through veins to become those limbs.\n\nDigested again, it descends to where\nsilence serves better than speech,\nthen drops upon another's blood\nin nature's vessel.\n\nThere one mingles with the other—\none meant to be passive, one active\nby virtue of the perfect place it springs from.\nUnited, they begin their work:\nfirst coagulating, then bringing life\nto what they've made substantial.\n\nThe active power, having become a soul\nlike a plant's—though different in this:\nthe plant has arrived while this is still traveling—\nthen works until it moves and feels\nlike sea-foam, and begins\norganizing the faculties it carries.\n\nNow, son, the power from the father's heart\nexpands and extends itself,\nwhere nature focuses on every limb.\n\nBut how the animal becomes human—\nthis you don't yet see. This very point\nled a wiser man than you to err,\nmaking him separate in his teaching\nthe soul from the possible intellect,\nseeing no organ it could claim.\n\nOpen your heart to the approaching truth:\nknow that as soon as the brain's structure\nis perfect in the fetus,\nthe Prime Mover turns toward it, pleased\nat nature's great artistry, and breathes in\na new spirit, complete with power,\nwhich draws into its own substance\nwhat it finds active there,\nbecoming one soul that lives, feels, and reflects upon itself.\n\nSo you'll wonder less at what I say,\nconsider the sun's heat becoming wine\nwhen joined with juice flowing from the vine.\n\nWhen Lachesis has no more thread,\nthe soul separates from flesh and bears with it,\nin potential, both human and divine nature.\nAll other faculties fall silent—\nmemory, intelligence, and will\nact far more vigorously than before.\n\nWithout pause, it falls miraculously\nto one shore or the other,\nthere first learning which path is its own.\n\nAs soon as place encircles it,\nthe forming power radiates around\nas it did, and as much, in living limbs.\n\nAnd as air, when full of rain,\nadorns itself with diverse colors\nfrom alien rays reflected in it,\nso the neighboring air shapes itself\ninto that form which the soul,\nnow stationary, impresses upon it.\n\nThen, like the little flame\nthat follows fire wherever it moves,\nthe new form follows the spirit.\n\nSince it takes its appearance from this,\nit's called a shade, and from this\norganizes every sense, even sight.\n\nFrom this we speak and laugh,\nfrom this we form our tears and sighs\nyou may have heard upon the mountain.\nAs our desires and other feelings move us,\nso the shade takes shape—\nthis is the cause of what amazes you.\"\n\nNow we had reached the final circle\nand turned toward the right,\nour attention caught by another concern.\n\nHere the bank shoots forth flames of fire,\nwhile the ledge breathes upward a wind\nthat drives them back and holds them off.\n\nSo we had to walk the open side,\none by one—and I feared the fire\non this side, the drop on that.\n\nMy guide said: \"Along this place\nyou must keep your eyes on a tight rein,\nsince error comes so easily here.\"\n\n\"Summae Deus clementiae\"—I heard this\nsung within the heart of the great burning,\nmaking me no less eager to turn and look.\n\nI saw spirits walking through the flames,\nso I divided my gaze between\nmy own steps and theirs.\n\nAfter the hymn's conclusion,\nthey shouted aloud: \"Virum non cognosco!\"\nThen began the hymn again, voices low.\n\nWhen this ended too, they cried:\n\"Diana ran into the woods\nand drove out Helice, who had felt Venus's poison.\"\n\nThen they returned to song, then called out\nthe names of wives and husbands who were chaste,\nas virtue and marriage vows require.\n\nI believe this practice serves them\nfor all the time the fire burns them—\nwith such care and nourishment\nthe final wound must be healed.",

      "original": "one before the other We went upon our way, oft the good Master Said: \"Take thou heed! suffice it that I warn thee.\" On the right shoulder smote me now the sun, That, raying out, already the whole west Changed from its azure aspect into white. And with my shadow did I make the flame Appear more red; and even to such a sign Shades saw I many, as they went, give heed. This was the cause that gave them a beginning To speak of me; and to themselves began they To say: \"That seems not a factitious body!\" Then towards me, as far as they could come, Came certain of them, always with regard Not to step forth where they would not be burned. \"O thou who goest, not from being slower But reverent perhaps, behind the others, Answer me, who in thirst and fire am burning. Nor to me only is thine answer needful; For all of these have greater thirst for it Than for cold water Ethiop or Indian. Tell us how is it that thou makest thyself A wall unto the sun, as if thou hadst not Entered as yet into the net of death.\" Thus one of them addressed me, and I straight Should have revealed myself, were I not bent On other novelty that then appeared. For through the middle of the burning road There came a people face to face with these, Which held me in suspense with gazing at them. 253 There see I hastening upon either side Each of the shades, and kissing one another Without a pause, content with brief salute. Thus in the middle of their brown battalions Muzzle to muzzle one ant meets another Perchance to spy their journey or their fortune. No sooner is the friendly greeting ended, Or ever the first footstep passes onward, Each one endeavours to outcry the other; The new-come people: \"Sodom and Gomorrah!\" The rest: \"Into the cow Pasiphae enters, So that the bull unto her lust may run!\" Then as the cranes, that to Riphaean mountains Might fly in part, and part towards the sands, These of the frost, those of the sun avoidant, One folk is going, and the other coming, And weeping they return to their first songs, And to the cry that most befitteth them; And close to me approached, even as before, The very same who had entreated me, Attent to listen in their countenance. I, who their inclination twice had seen, Began: \"O souls secure in the possession, Whene'er it may be, of a state of peace, Neither unripe nor ripened have remained My members upon earth, but here are with me With their own blood and their articulations. I go up here to be no longer blind; A Lady is above, who wins this grace, Whereby the mortal through your world I bring. But as your greatest longing satisfied May soon become, so that the Heaven may house you Which full of love is, and most amply spreads, Tell me, that I again in books may write it, Who are you, and what is that multitude Which goes upon its way behind your backs?\" Not otherwise with wonder is bewildered The mountaineer, and staring round is dumb, When rough and rustic to the town he goes, Than every shade became in its appearance; 254 \nBut when they of their stupor were disburdened, Which in high hearts is quickly quieted, \"Blessed be thou, who of our border-lands,\" He recommenced who first had questioned us, \"Experience freightest for a better life. The folk that comes not with us have offended In that for which once Caesar, triumphing, Heard himself called in contumely, 'Queen.' Therefore they separate, exclaiming, 'Sodom!' Themselves reproving, even as thou hast heard, And add unto their burning by their shame. Our own transgression was hermaphrodite; But because we observed not human law, Following like unto beasts our appetite, In our opprobrium by us is read, When we part company, the name of her Who bestialized herself in bestial wood. Now knowest thou our acts, and what our crime was; Wouldst thou perchance by name know who we are, There is not time to tell, nor could I do it. Thy wish to know me shall in sooth be granted; I'm Guido Guinicelli, and now purge me, Having repented ere the hour extreme.\" The same that in the sadness of Lycurgus Two sons became, their mother re-beholding, Such I became, but rise not to such height, The moment I heard name himself the father Of me and of my betters, who had ever Practised the sweet and gracious rhymes of love; And without speech and hearing thoughtfully For a long time I went, beholding him, Nor for the fire did I approach him nearer. When I was fed with looking, utterly Myself I offered ready for his service, With affirmation that compels belief. And he to me: \"Thou leavest footprints such In me, from what I hear, and so distinct, Lethe cannot efface them, nor make dim. But if thy words just now the truth have sworn, Tell me what is the cause why thou displayest 255 \nIn word and look that dear thou holdest me?\" And I to him: \"Those dulcet lays of yours Which, long as shall endure our modern fashion, Shall make for ever dear their very ink!\" \"O brother,\" said he, \"he whom I point out,\" And here he pointed at a spirit in front, \"Was of the mother tongue a better smith. Verses of love and proses of romance, He mastered all; and let the idiots talk, Who think the Lemosin surpasses him. To clamour more than truth they turn their faces, And in this way establish their opinion, Ere art or reason has by them been heard. Thus many ancients with Guittone did, From cry to cry still giving him applause, Until the truth has conquered with most persons. Now, if thou hast such ample privilege 'Tis granted thee to go unto the cloister Wherein is Christ the abbot of the college, To him repeat for me a Paternoster, So far as needful to us of this world, Where power of sinning is no longer ours.\" Then, to give place perchance to one behind, Whom he had near, he vanished in the fire As fish in water going to the bottom. I moved a little tow'rds him pointed out, And said that to his name my own desire An honourable place was making ready. He of his own free will began to say: 'Tan m' abellis vostre cortes deman, Que jeu nom' puesc ni vueill a vos cobrire; Jeu sui Arnaut, que plor e vai chantan; Consiros vei la passada folor, E vei jauzen lo jorn qu' esper denan. Ara vus prec per aquella valor, Que vus condus al som de la scalina, Sovenga vus a temprar ma dolor.'* Then hid him in the fire that purifies them. * So pleases me your courteous demand, I cannot and I will not hide me from you. 256 \nI am Arnaut, who weep and singing go; Contrite I see the folly of the past, And joyous see the hoped-for day before me. Therefore do I implore you, by that power Which guides you to the summit of the stairs, Be mindful to assuage my suffering! 257",
      "modern": "We moved forward one behind the other,\nmy good Master often saying: \"Watch your step!\nLet my warning be enough for you.\"\n\nThe sun now struck my right shoulder,\nits rays already transforming the whole west\nfrom azure blue to white.\nMy shadow made the flames appear more red,\nand I saw many shades take notice of this sign\nas they passed by.\n\nThis gave them reason to begin speaking of me.\nThey started saying to each other:\n\"That doesn't look like a phantom body!\"\n\nThen some of them came toward me,\nas close as they could manage\nwhile being careful not to step outside the fire\nwhere they would burn.\n\n\"You who walk behind the others—\nnot from slowness, it seems, but from reverence—\nanswer me, I who burn in thirst and flame.\nYour answer isn't needed by me alone;\nall of these souls thirst for it more desperately\nthan any Ethiopian or Indian thirsts for cold water.\n\nTell us how you cast a shadow against the sun,\nas if you haven't yet been caught\nin death's net.\"\n\nOne of them spoke to me this way,\nand I would have revealed myself immediately,\nexcept I was distracted by something new appearing.\n\nThrough the middle of the burning road\ncame another group of souls, face to face with these,\nand I stared at them in suspense.\n\nI watched as shades from both sides\nrushed toward each other, kissing quickly\nwithout pause, content with brief greeting.\nLike ants in their dark battalions\nmeeting muzzle to muzzle,\nperhaps to learn of journey or fortune.\n\nAs soon as the friendly greeting ended,\nbefore even the first step could pass onward,\neach group tried to outcry the other:\nThe newcomers shouted: \"Sodom and Gomorrah!\"\nThe others: \"Pasiphaë enters the cow\nso the bull can service her lust!\"\n\nThen like cranes that might fly partly\ntoward the northern mountains, partly toward warm sands—\nsome avoiding frost, others avoiding sun—\none group departed while the other approached,\nweeping as they returned to their first songs\nand to the cry that best suited them.\n\nThe same souls who had questioned me before\ncame close again, their faces eager to listen.\n\nHaving seen their desire twice now, I began:\n\"Souls who are assured of eventually reaching\na state of peace, whenever that may be—\nmy limbs have remained neither unripe nor overripe\non earth, but are here with me still\nwith their blood and joints intact.\n\nI climb upward to be blind no longer.\nA Lady above wins this grace for me,\nallowing me to carry my mortal body through your world.\n\nBut so that your greatest longing may soon\nbe satisfied, and Heaven may house you—\nthat Heaven which is full of love and spreads most wide—\ntell me, so I may write it in my books again:\nWho are you? And who is that multitude\nwalking away behind your backs?\"\n\nA mountaineer is never more bewildered,\nstaring around speechless when rough and rustic\nhe first enters a town,\nthan every shade appeared at that moment.\n\nBut once they recovered from their amazement—\nwhich in noble hearts is quickly calmed—\nthe one who had first questioned me began again:\n\n\"Blessed are you, who freight yourself\nwith experience of our borderlands\nfor a better life!\n\nThe people who don't walk with us\nsinned in the way for which Caesar once heard himself\nmockingly called 'Queen' during his triumph.\nThat's why they separate crying 'Sodom!'—\nreproaching themselves, as you heard,\nadding shame to their burning.\n\nOur transgression was hermaphroditic.\nBut because we didn't observe human law,\nfollowing our appetites like beasts,\nwe read out in our disgrace, when we part,\nthe name of her who made herself bestial\nin the bestial wood.\n\nNow you know our acts and our crime.\nIf you'd like to know our names,\nthere isn't time to tell them, nor could I.\n\nYour wish to know me will indeed be granted:\nI am Guido Guinicelli, and I purge myself here\nbecause I repented before my final hour.\"\n\nLike the two sons who, in Lycurgus's grief,\nsaw their mother again—\nsuch I became, though I didn't rise to such heights—\nthe moment I heard him name himself the father\nof me and my betters, who had always\npracticed the sweet and gracious rhymes of love.\n\nWithout speaking or listening, lost in thought\nfor a long time I walked, gazing at him,\nnor did the fire make me approach him closer.\n\nWhen I had fed on looking at him,\nI offered myself completely for his service\nwith words that compel belief.\n\nAnd he to me: \"From what I hear,\nyou leave such clear footprints in me\nthat Lethe cannot wash them away or dim them.\n\nBut if your words just now swore truth,\ntell me why you show in word and look\nthat you hold me dear?\"\n\nAnd I to him: \"Those sweet songs of yours—\nwhich, as long as our modern language endures,\nwill make their very ink forever precious!\"\n\n\"Brother,\" he said, \"the one I point out to you\"—\nand here he indicated a spirit ahead—\n\"was a better craftsman of our mother tongue.\n\nIn verses of love and prose romances\nhe surpassed all others.

      "original": "upon the Stairway, and his Dream of Leah and Rachel. Arrival at the Terrestrial Paradise. As when he vibrates forth his earliest rays, In regions where his Maker shed his blood, (The Ebro falling under lofty Libra, And waters in the Ganges burnt with noon,) So stood the Sun; hence was the day departing, When the glad Angel of God appeared to us. Outside the flame he stood upon the verge, And chanted forth, \"Beati mundo corde,\" In voice by far more living than our own. Then: \"No one farther goes, souls sanctified, If first the fire bite not; within it enter, And be not deaf unto the song beyond.\" When we were close beside him thus he said; Wherefore e'en such became I, when I heard him, As he is who is put into the grave. Upon my clasped hands I straightened me, Scanning the fire, and vividly recalling The human bodies I had once seen burned. Towards me turned themselves my good Conductors, And unto me Virgilius said: \"My son, Here may indeed be torment, but not death. Remember thee, remember! and if I On Geryon have safely guided thee, What shall I do now I am nearer God? Believe for certain, shouldst thou stand a full Millennium in the bosom of this flame, It could not make thee bald a single hair. And if perchance thou think that I deceive thee, 258 Draw near to it, and put it to the proof With thine own hands upon thy garment's hem. Now lay aside, now lay aside all fear, Turn hitherward, and onward come securely;\" And I still motionless, and 'gainst my conscience! Seeing me stand still motionless and stubborn, Somewhat disturbed he said: \"Now look thou, Son, 'Twixt Beatrice and thee there is this wall.\" As at the name of Thisbe oped his lids The dying Pyramus, and gazed upon her, What time the mulberry became vermilion, Even thus, my obduracy being softened, I turned to my wise Guide, hearing the name That in my memory evermore is welling. Whereat he wagged his head, and said: \"How now? Shall we stay on this side?\" then smiled as one Does at a child who's vanquished by an apple. Then into the fire in front of me he entered, Beseeching Statius to come after me, Who a long way before divided us. When I was in it, into molten glass I would have cast me to refresh myself, So without measure was the burning there! And my sweet Father, to encourage me, Discoursing still of Beatrice went on, Saying: \"Her eyes I seem to see already!\" A voice, that on the other side was singing, Directed us, and we, attent alone On that, came forth where the ascent began. \"Venite, benedicti Patris mei,\" Sounded within a splendour, which was there Such it o'ercame me, and I could not look. \"The sun departs,\" it added, \"and night cometh; Tarry ye not, but onward urge your steps, So long as yet the west becomes not dark.\" Straight forward through the rock the path ascended In such a way that I cut off the rays Before me of the sun, that now was low. And of few stairs we yet had made assay, Ere by the vanished shadow the sun's setting 259 \nBehind us we perceived, I and my Sages. And ere in all its parts immeasurable The horizon of one aspect had become, And Night her boundless dispensation held, Each of us of a stair had made his bed; Because the nature of the mount took from us The power of climbing, more than the delight. Even as in ruminating passive grow The goats, who have been swift and venturesome Upon the mountain-tops ere they were fed, Hushed in the shadow, while the sun is hot, Watched by the herdsman, who upon his staff Is leaning, and in leaning tendeth them; And as the shepherd, lodging out of doors, Passes the night beside his quiet flock, Watching that no wild beast may scatter it, Such at that hour were we, all three of us, I like the goat, and like the herdsmen they, Begirt on this side and on that by rocks. Little could there be seen of things without; But through that little I beheld the stars More luminous and larger than their wont. Thus ruminating, and beholding these, Sleep seized upon me,—sleep, that oftentimes Before a deed is done has tidings of it. It was the hour, I think, when from the East First on the mountain Citherea beamed, Who with the fire of love seems always burning; Youthful and beautiful in dreams methought I saw a lady walking in a meadow, Gathering flowers; and singing she was saying: \"Know whosoever may my name demand That I am Leah, and go moving round My beauteous hands to make myself a garland. To please me at the mirror, here I deck me, But never does my sister Rachel leave Her looking-glass, and sitteth all day long. To see her beauteous eyes as eager is she, As I am to adorn me with my hands; Her, seeing, and me, doing satisfies.\" 260 \nAnd now before the antelucan splendours That unto pilgrims the more grateful rise, As, home-returning, less remote they lodge, The darkness fled away on every side, And slumber with it; whereupon I rose, Seeing already the great Masters risen. \"That apple sweet, which through so many branches The care of mortals goeth in pursuit of, To-day shall put in peace thy hungerings.\" Speaking to me, Virgilius of such words As these made use; and never were there guerdons That could in pleasantness compare with these. Such longing upon longing came upon me To be above, that at each step thereafter For flight I felt in me the pinions growing. When underneath us was the stairway all Run o'er, and we were on the highest step, Virgilius fastened upon me his eyes, And said: \"The temporal fire and the eternal, Son, thou hast seen, and to a place art come Where of myself no farther I discern. By intellect and art I here have brought thee; Take thine own pleasure for thy guide henceforth; Beyond the steep ways and the narrow art thou. Behold the sun, that shines upon thy forehead; Behold the grass, the flowerets, and the shrubs Which of itself alone this land produces. Until rejoicing come the beauteous eyes Which weeping caused me to come unto thee, Thou canst sit down, and thou canst walk among them. Expect no more or word or sign from me; Free and upright and sound is thy free-will, And error were it not to do its bidding; Thee o'er thyself I therefore crown and mitre!\" 261",
      "modern": "The sun stood poised where its Creator once shed blood,\nthe Ebro flowing beneath towering Libra's scales,\nthe Ganges burning under noon's fierce light—\nand here the day was ending\nwhen God's radiant angel appeared before us.\n\nHe stood beyond the flame's edge on the precipice,\nchanting \"Blessed are the pure in heart\"\nin a voice more vibrant than any mortal sound.\nThen spoke: \"No soul goes farther, sanctified ones,\nunless the fire first bites you—enter within,\nand do not turn deaf ears to the song beyond.\"\n\nWhen I heard this, I became like one\nlowered into the grave.\nI straightened myself, hands clasped tight,\nstaring at the fire, my mind flooding\nwith vivid memories of human bodies\nI had seen consumed by flame.\n\nMy faithful guides turned toward me,\nand Virgil said: \"My son,\nhere there may be torment, but not death.\nRemember—remember!

A softly-breathing air, that no mutation Had in itself, upon the forehead smote me No heavier blow than of a gentle wind, Whereat the branches, lightly tremulous, Did all of them bow downward toward that side Where its first shadow casts the Holy Mountain; Yet not from their upright direction swayed, So that the little birds upon their tops Should leave the practice of each art of theirs; But with full ravishment the hours of prime, Singing, received they in the midst of leaves, That ever bore a burden to their rhymes, Such as from branch to branch goes gathering on Through the pine forest on the shore of Chiassi, When Eolus unlooses the Sirocco. Already my slow steps had carried me Into the ancient wood so far, that I Could not perceive where I had entered it.

All waters that on earth most limpid are Would seem to have within themselves some mixture 262 Compared with that which nothing doth conceal, Although it moves on with a brown, brown current Under the shade perpetual, that never Ray of the sun lets in, nor of the moon. With feet I stayed, and with mine eyes I passed Beyond the rivulet, to look upon The great variety of the fresh may. And there appeared to me (even as appears Suddenly something that doth turn aside Through very wonder every other thought) A lady all alone, who went along Singing and culling floweret after floweret, With which her pathway was all painted over. \"Ah, beauteous lady, who in rays of love Dost warm thyself, if I may trust to looks, Which the heart's witnesses are wont to be, May the desire come unto thee to draw Near to this river's bank,\" I said to her, \"So much that I might hear what thou art singing. Thou makest me remember where and what Proserpina that moment was when lost Her mother her, and she herself the Spring.\" As turns herself, with feet together pressed And to the ground, a lady who is dancing, And hardly puts one foot before the other, On the vermilion and the yellow flowerets She turned towards me, not in other wise Than maiden who her modest eyes casts down; And my entreaties made to be content, So near approaching, that the dulcet sound Came unto me together with its meaning As soon as she was where the grasses are. Bathed by the waters of the beauteous river, To lift her eyes she granted me the boon. I do not think there shone so great a light Under the lids of Venus, when transfixed By her own son, beyond his usual custom! Erect upon the other bank she smiled, Bearing full many colours in her hands, Which that high land produces without seed. 263 \nApart three paces did the river make us; But Hellespont, where Xerxes passed across, (A curb still to all human arrogance,) More hatred from Leander did not suffer For rolling between Sestos and Abydos, Than that from me, because it oped not then. \"Ye are new-comers; and because I smile,\" Began she, \"peradventure, in this place Elect to human nature for its nest, Some apprehension keeps you marvelling; But the psalm 'Delectasti' giveth light Which has the power to uncloud your intellect. And thou who foremost art, and didst entreat me, Speak, if thou wouldst hear more; for I came ready To all thy questionings, as far as needful.\" \"The water,\" said I, \"and the forest's sound, Are combating within me my new faith In something which I heard opposed to this.\" Whence she: \"I will relate how from its cause Proceedeth that which maketh thee to wonder, And purge away the cloud that smites upon thee. The Good Supreme, sole in itself delighting, Created man good, and this goodly place Gave him as hansel of eternal peace. By his default short while he sojourned here; By his default to weeping and to toil He changed his innocent laughter and sweet play. That the disturbance which below is made By exhalations of the land and water, (Which far as may be follow after heat,) Might not upon mankind wage any war, This mount ascended tow'rds the heaven so high, And is exempt, from there where it is locked. Now since the universal atmosphere Turns in a circuit with the primal motion Unless the circle is broken on some side, Upon this height, that all is disengaged In living ether, doth this motion strike And make the forest sound, for it is dense; And so much power the stricken plant possesses 264 \nThat with its virtue it impregns the air, And this, revolving, scatters it around; And yonder earth, according as 'tis worthy In self or in its clime, conceives and bears Of divers qualities the divers trees; It should not seem a marvel then on earth, This being heard, whenever any plant Without seed manifest there taketh root. And thou must know, this holy table-land In which thou art is full of every seed, And fruit has in it never gathered there. The water which thou seest springs not from vein Restored by vapour that the cold condenses, Like to a stream that gains or loses breath; But issues from a fountain safe and certain, Which by the will of God as much regains As it discharges, open on two sides. Upon this side with virtue it descends, Which takes away all memory of sin; On that, of every good deed done restores it. Here Lethe, as upon the other side Eunoe, it is called; and worketh not If first on either side it be not tasted. This every other savour doth transcend; And notwithstanding slaked so far may be Thy thirst, that I reveal to thee no more, I'll give thee a corollary still in grace, Nor think my speech will be to thee less dear If it spread out beyond my promise to thee. Those who in ancient times have feigned in song The Age of Gold and its felicity, Dreamed of this place perhaps upon Parnassus. Here was the human race in innocence; Here evermore was Spring, and every fruit; This is the nectar of which each one speaks.\" Then backward did I turn me wholly round Unto my Poets, and saw that with a smile They had been listening to these closing words; Then to the beautiful lady turned mine eyes. 265",
      "modern": "Into the heavenly forest, dense and living-green,\nwhich softened the newborn day for my eyes,\nI left the riverbank without delay,\nwalking slowly across the level ground\nover soil that breathed fragrance everywhere.\n\nA gentle breeze that never changed\nstruck my forehead no harder than a soft wind.\nThe branches, trembling lightly in the air,\nall swayed toward the side where the Holy Mountain\ncast its first shadow, yet stayed upright enough\nthat the small birds perched on their tops\nnever stopped practicing their songs.\n\nWith pure delight they welcomed the dawn hours,\nsinging among leaves that kept perfect time,\nlike the sound that gathers from branch to branch\nthrough the pine forest along Chiassi's shore\nwhen the wind god releases the south wind.\n\nMy slow steps had already carried me\nso deep into the ancient wood\nthat I could no longer see where I'd entered.\n\nThen a stream blocked my path,\nbending leftward with small waves\nthat pressed down the grass along its banks.\nAll the clearest waters on earth\nwould seem clouded in comparison\nto this stream that concealed nothing,\nthough it flowed with a dark current\nunder perpetual shade that never let in\na ray of sun or moon.\n\nI stopped walking and let my eyes travel\nacross the stream to see\nthe rich variety of fresh blooms.\n\nAnd there appeared to me—as suddenly\nas something that drives away all other thoughts\nthrough pure wonder—a woman walking alone,\nsinging and gathering flower after flower\nthat painted her entire path with color.\n\n\"Beautiful lady, who warms herself\nin love's rays,\" I called to her,\n\"if I can trust what I see in your face,\nwhich usually reveals the heart's truth,\nwould you draw near this riverbank\nso I might hear what you're singing?\nYou remind me of where Proserpina was\nand what she was doing when her mother lost her\nand she herself lost the spring.\"\n\nLike a dancing woman who turns\nwith feet pressed together to the ground,\nbarely placing one foot before the other,\nshe turned toward me among the red and yellow flowers\nthe way a maiden casts down modest eyes.\nShe granted my request, coming so close\nthat the sweet sound reached me\nalong with its meaning.\n\nWhen she reached the place where grass\nis bathed by the beautiful river's waters,\nshe gave me the gift of lifting her eyes.\nI don't think such brilliant light ever shone\nbeneath Venus's eyelids when her son\npierced her with his arrow.\n\nStanding upright on the far bank, she smiled,\nholding in her hands the many colors\nthat this high land produces without seeds.\nThe river kept us three paces apart—\nbut the Hellespont, where Xerxes crossed\n(still a lesson for human pride),\nnever suffered more hatred from Leander\nfor rolling between Sestos and Abydos\nthan I felt for that stream because it wouldn't open.\n\n\"You are newcomers,\" she began, \"and perhaps\nbecause I smile here in this place\nchosen as humanity's true home,\nsome wonder keeps you marveling.\nBut the psalm 'You have made me glad' gives light\nthat can clear the clouds from your understanding.\n\nAnd you who stand in front and asked me to come near—\nspeak if you want to hear more.\nI came ready to answer all your questions.\"\n\n\"The water and the forest's sound,\" I said,\n\"are battling in me against new faith\nin something I heard that contradicts this.\"\n\n\"I will tell you how the cause produces\nwhat makes you wonder,\" she replied,\n\"and clear away the cloud that strikes you.\n\nThe Supreme Good, delighting in itself alone,\ncreated humanity good, and gave this lovely place\nas a pledge of eternal peace.\nThrough human failure, we stayed here briefly;\nthrough human failure, innocent laughter and sweet play\nwere changed to weeping and toil.\n\nSo that the disturbances made below\nby vapors from earth and water\nfollowing heat as far as they can\nmight wage no war against humanity,\nthis mountain rose so high toward heaven\nand stands free from the point where it is sealed.\n\nNow since the universal atmosphere\nturns in a circle with the primal motion,\nunless that circle breaks somewhere,\nupon this height that stands entirely free\nin living air, this motion strikes\nand makes the forest sound because it's dense.\n\nThe struck plant has such power\nthat it fills the air with its essence,\nand the air, revolving, scatters this around.\nThe earth below, according to its worth\nin soil or climate, conceives and bears\ndifferent trees of different qualities.\n\nHearing this, it shouldn't seem miraculous\nwhen any plant takes root on earth\nwithout visible seed.\n\nAnd you must know this sacred plateau\nwhere you stand is full of every seed,\nand bears fruit never harvested elsewhere.\n\nThe water you see doesn't spring from veins\nrestored by vapor that cold condenses,\nlike a stream that gains or loses strength,\nbut flows from a fountain sure and constant\nthat regains by God's will as much\nas it pours out on two sides.\n\nOn this side it descends with the power\nto take away all memory of sin;\non the other side, it restores memory of every good deed.\nHere it's called Lethe, on the other side Eunoe,\nand it doesn't work unless first tasted\non both sides.\n\nThis surpasses every other taste.\nAnd though your thirst might be satisfied\nwithout my revealing more,\nI'll give you one more grace as gift—\nI don't think my words will be less dear to you\nif they go beyond what I promised.\n\nThose who in ancient times sang of\nthe Golden Age and its happiness\nperhaps dreamed of this place on Parnassus.\nHere the human race lived in innocence;\nhere spring was eternal, and every fruit;\nthis is the nectar everyone speaks of.\"\n\nI turned completely around to my guides\nand saw that they had been listening\nto these final words with smiles.\nThen I turned my eyes back to the beautiful lady.",

      "original": "Singing like unto an enamoured lady She, with the ending of her words, continued: \"Beati quorum tecta sunt peccata.\" And even as Nymphs, that wandered all alone Among the sylvan shadows, sedulous One to avoid and one to see the sun, She then against the stream moved onward, going Along the bank, and I abreast of her, Her little steps with little steps attending. Between her steps and mine were not a hundred, When equally the margins gave a turn, In such a way, that to the East I faced. Nor even thus our way continued far Before the lady wholly turned herself Unto me, saying, \"Brother, look and listen!\" And lo! a sudden lustre ran across On every side athwart the spacious forest, Such that it made me doubt if it were lightning. But since the lightning ceases as it comes, And that continuing brightened more and more, Within my thought I said, \"What thing is this?\" And a delicious melody there ran Along the luminous air, whence holy zeal Made me rebuke the hardihood of Eve; For there where earth and heaven obedient were, The woman only, and but just created, Could not endure to stay 'neath any veil; Underneath which had she devoutly stayed, I sooner should have tasted those delights Ineffable, and for a longer time. 266 While 'mid such manifold first-fruits I walked Of the eternal pleasure all enrapt, And still solicitous of more delights, In front of us like an enkindled fire Became the air beneath the verdant boughs, And the sweet sound as singing now was heard. O Virgins sacrosanct! if ever hunger, Vigils, or cold for you I have endured, The occasion spurs me their reward to claim! Now Helicon must needs pour forth for me, And with her choir Urania must assist me, To put in verse things difficult to think. A little farther on, seven trees of gold In semblance the long space still intervening Between ourselves and them did counterfeit; But when I had approached so near to them The common object, which the sense deceives, Lost not by distance any of its marks, The faculty that lends discourse to reason Did apprehend that they were candlesticks, And in the voices of the song \"Hosanna!\" Above them flamed the harness beautiful, Far brighter than the moon in the serene Of midnight, at the middle of her month. I turned me round, with admiration filled, To good Virgilius, and he answered me With visage no less full of wonderment. Then back I turned my face to those high things, Which moved themselves towards us so sedately, They had been distanced by new-wedded brides. The lady chid me: \"Why dost thou burn only So with affection for the living lights, And dost not look at what comes after them?\" Then saw I people, as behind their leaders, Coming behind them, garmented in white, And such a whiteness never was on earth. The water on my left flank was resplendent, And back to me reflected my left side, E'en as a mirror, if I looked therein. When I upon my margin had such post 267 \nThat nothing but the stream divided us, Better to see I gave my steps repose; And I beheld the flamelets onward go, Leaving behind themselves the air depicted, And they of trailing pennons had the semblance, So that it overhead remained distinct With sevenfold lists, all of them of the colours Whence the sun's bow is made, and Delia's girdle. These standards to the rearward longer were Than was my sight; and, as it seemed to me, Ten paces were the outermost apart. Under so fair a heaven as I describe The four and twenty Elders, two by two, Came on incoronate with flower-de-luce. They all of them were singing: \"Blessed thou Among the daughters of Adam art, and blessed For evermore shall be thy loveliness.\" After the flowers and other tender grasses In front of me upon the other margin Were disencumbered of that race elect, Even as in heaven star followeth after star, There came close after them four animals, Incoronate each one with verdant leaf. Plumed with six wings was every one of them, The plumage full of eyes; the eyes of Argus If they were living would be such as these. Reader! to trace their forms no more I waste My rhymes; for other spendings press me so, That I in this cannot be prodigal. But read Ezekiel, who depicteth them As he beheld them from the region cold Coming with cloud, with whirlwind, and with fire; And such as thou shalt find them in his pages, Such were they here; saving that in their plumage John is with me, and differeth from him. The interval between these four contained A chariot triumphal on two wheels, Which by a Griffin's neck came drawn along; And upward he extended both his wings Between the middle list and three and three, 268 \nSo that he injured none by cleaving it. So high they rose that they were lost to sight; His limbs were gold, so far as he was bird, And white the others with vermilion mingled. Not only Rome with no such splendid car E'er gladdened Africanus, or Augustus, But poor to it that of the Sun would be,— That of the Sun, which swerving was burnt up At the importunate orison of Earth, When Jove was so mysteriously just. Three maidens at the right wheel in a circle Came onward dancing; one so very red That in the fire she hardly had been noted. The second was as if her flesh and bones Had all been fashioned out of emerald; The third appeared as snow but newly fallen. And now they seemed conducted by the white, Now by the red, and from the song of her The others took their step, or slow or swift. Upon the left hand four made holiday Vested in purple, following the measure Of one of them with three eyes m her head. In rear of all the group here treated of Two old men I beheld, unlike in habit, But like in gait, each dignified and grave. One showed himself as one of the disciples Of that supreme Hippocrates, whom nature Made for the animals she holds most dear; Contrary care the other manifested, With sword so shining and so sharp, it caused Terror to me on this side of the river. Thereafter four I saw of humble aspect, And behind all an aged man alone Walking in sleep with countenance acute. And like the foremost company these seven Were habited; yet of the flower-de-luce No garland round about the head they wore, But of the rose, and other flowers vermilion; At little distance would the sight have sworn That all were in a flame above their brows. 269 \nAnd when the car was opposite to me Thunder was heard; and all that folk august Seemed to have further progress interdicted, There with the vanward ensigns standing still. 270",
      "modern": "She continued singing like a woman in love,\nand when her words ended, she sang:\n\"Blessed are those whose sins are covered.\"\n\nLike nymphs who once wandered alone through woodland shadows—\none seeking to avoid the sun, another yearning to see it—\nshe moved upstream along the bank,\nand I walked beside her, matching her small steps with mine.\n\nWe had not taken a hundred paces\nwhen both margins curved equally,\nturning me to face the east.\nWe had not traveled much farther\nwhen the lady turned completely toward me, saying:\n\"Brother, look and listen!\"\n\nSuddenly a brilliant light swept across\nthe vast forest on every side,\nso intense I wondered if it was lightning.\nBut lightning ceases as it comes,\nwhile this light continued, growing brighter and brighter.\nI thought to myself: \"What is this?\"\n\nA ravishing melody flowed\nthrough the luminous air, and holy fervor\nmade me condemn Eve's reckless act.\nFor there, where earth and heaven were obedient,\nthat woman—alone and newly created—\ncould not bear to remain beneath any veil.\nHad she stayed humbly covered,\nI would have tasted those ineffable delights\nsooner and for much longer.\n\nWhile I walked among such abundant first fruits\nof eternal pleasure, completely enraptured\nyet still yearning for greater joys,\nthe air beneath the green boughs\nburst into flame before us,\nand the sweet sound became clear singing.\n\nO sacred Virgins!

And one of them, as if by Heaven commissioned, Singing, \"Veni, sponsa, de Libano\" Shouted three times, and all the others after. Even as the Blessed at the final summons Shall rise up quickened each one from his cavern, Uplifting light the reinvested flesh, So upon that celestial chariot A hundred rose 'ad vocem tanti senis,' Ministers and messengers of life eternal. They all were saying, \"Benedictus qui venis,\" And, scattering flowers above and round about, \"Manibus o date lilia plenis.\" Ere now have I beheld, as day began, The eastern hemisphere all tinged with rose, And the other heaven with fair serene adorned; And the sun's face, uprising, overshadowed So that by tempering influence of vapours For a long interval the eye sustained it; Thus in the bosom of a cloud of flowers Which from those hands angelical ascended, And downward fell again inside and out, 271 Over her snow-white veil with olive cinct Appeared a lady under a green mantle, Vested in colour of the living flame. And my own spirit, that already now So long a time had been, that in her presence Trembling with awe it had not stood abashed, Without more knowledge having by mine eyes, Through occult virtue that from her proceeded Of ancient love the mighty influence felt. As soon as on my vision smote the power Sublime, that had already pierced me through Ere from my boyhood I had yet come forth, To the left hand I turned with that reliance With which the little child runs to his mother, When he has fear, or when he is afflicted, To say unto Virgilius: \"Not a drachm Of blood remains in me, that does not tremble; I know the traces of the ancient flame.\" But us Virgilius of himself deprived Had left, Virgilius, sweetest of all fathers, Virgilius, to whom I for safety gave me: Nor whatsoever lost the ancient mother Availed my cheeks now purified from dew, That weeping they should not again be darkened. \"Dante, because Virgilius has departed Do not weep yet, do not weep yet awhile; For by another sword thou need'st must weep.\" E'en as an admiral, who on poop and prow Comes to behold the people that are working In other ships, and cheers them to well-doing, Upon the left hand border of the car, When at the sound I turned of my own name, Which of necessity is here recorded, I saw the Lady, who erewhile appeared Veiled underneath the angelic festival, Direct her eyes to me across the river. Although the veil, that from her head descended, Encircled with the foliage of Minerva, Did not permit her to appear distinctly, In attitude still royally majestic 272 \nContinued she, like unto one who speaks, And keeps his warmest utterance in reserve: \"Look at me well; in sooth I'm Beatrice! How didst thou deign to come unto the Mountain? Didst thou not know that man is happy here?\" Mine eyes fell downward into the clear fountain, But, seeing myself therein, I sought the grass, So great a shame did weigh my forehead down. As to the son the mother seems superb, So she appeared to me; for somewhat bitter Tasteth the savour of severe compassion. Silent became she, and the Angels sang Suddenly, \"In te, Domine, speravi:\" But beyond 'pedes meos' did not pass. Even as the snow among the living rafters Upon the back of Italy congeals, Blown on and drifted by Sclavonian winds, And then, dissolving, trickles through itself Whene'er the land that loses shadow breathes, So that it seems a fire that melts a taper; E'en thus was I without a tear or sigh, Before the song of those who sing for ever After the music of the eternal spheres. But when I heard in their sweet melodies Compassion for me, more than had they said, \"O wherefore, lady, dost thou thus upbraid him?\" The ice, that was about my heart congealed, To air and water changed, and in my anguish Through mouth and eyes came gushing from my breast. She, on the right-hand border of the car Still firmly standing, to those holy beings Thus her discourse directed afterwards: \"Ye keep your watch in the eternal day, So that nor night nor sleep can steal from you One step the ages make upon their path; Therefore my answer is with greater care, That he may hear me who is weeping yonder, So that the sin and dole be of one measure. Not only by the work of those great wheels, That destine every seed unto some end, 273 \nAccording as the stars are in conjunction, But by the largess of celestial graces, Which have such lofty vapours for their rain That near to them our sight approaches not, Such had this man become in his new life Potentially, that every righteous habit Would have made admirable proof in him; But so much more malignant and more savage Becomes the land untilled and with bad seed, The more good earthly vigour it possesses. Some time did I sustain him with my look; Revealing unto him my youthful eyes, I led him with me turned in the right way. As soon as ever of my second age I was upon the threshold and changed life, Himself from me he took and gave to others. When from the flesh to spirit I ascended, And beauty and virtue were in me increased, I was to him less dear and less delightful; And into ways untrue he turned his steps, Pursuing the false images of good, That never any promises fulfil; Nor prayer for inspiration me availed, By means of which in dreams and otherwise I called him back, so little did he heed them. So low he fell, that all appliances For his salvation were already short, Save showing him the people of perdition. For this I visited the gates of death, And unto him, who so far up has led him, My intercessions were with weeping borne.

      "original": "O thou who art beyond the sacred river,\" Turning to me the point of her discourse, That edgewise even had seemed to me so keen, She recommenced, continuing without pause, \"Say, say if this be true; to such a charge, Thy own confession needs must be conjoined.\" My faculties were in so great confusion, That the voice moved, but sooner was extinct Than by its organs it was set at large. Awhile she waited; then she said: \"What thinkest? Answer me; for the mournful memories In thee not yet are by the waters injured.\" Confusion and dismay together mingled Forced such a Yes! from out my mouth, that sight Was needful to the understanding of it. Even as a cross-bow breaks, when 'tis discharged Too tensely drawn the bowstring and the bow, And with less force the arrow hits the mark, So I gave way beneath that heavy burden, Outpouring in a torrent tears and sighs, And the voice flagged upon its passage forth. Whence she to me: \"In those desires of mine Which led thee to the loving of that good, Beyond which there is nothing to aspire to, What trenches lying traverse or what chains Didst thou discover, that of passing onward Thou shouldst have thus despoiled thee of the hope? And what allurements or what vantages Upon the forehead of the others showed, 275 That thou shouldst turn thy footsteps unto them?\" After the heaving of a bitter sigh, Hardly had I the voice to make response, And with fatigue my lips did fashion it. Weeping I said: \"The things that present were With their false pleasure turned aside my steps, Soon as your countenance concealed itself.\" And she: \"Shouldst thou be silent, or deny What thou confessest, not less manifest Would be thy fault, by such a Judge 'tis known. But when from one's own cheeks comes bursting forth The accusal of the sin, in our tribunal Against the edge the wheel doth turn itself. But still, that thou mayst feel a greater shame For thy transgression, and another time Hearing the Sirens thou mayst be more strong, Cast down the seed of weeping and attend; So shalt thou hear, how in an opposite way My buried flesh should have directed thee. Never to thee presented art or nature Pleasure so great as the fair limbs wherein I was enclosed, which scattered are in earth. And if the highest pleasure thus did fail thee By reason of my death, what mortal thing Should then have drawn thee into its desire? Thou oughtest verily at the first shaft Of things fallacious to have risen up To follow me, who was no longer such. Thou oughtest not to have stooped thy pinions downward To wait for further blows, or little girl, Or other vanity of such brief use. The callow birdlet waits for two or three, But to the eyes of those already fledged, In vain the net is spread or shaft is shot.\" Even as children silent in their shame Stand listening with their eyes upon the ground, And conscious of their fault, and penitent; So was I standing; and she said: \"If thou In hearing sufferest pain, lift up thy beard And thou shalt feel a greater pain in seeing.\" 276 \nWith less resistance is a robust holm Uprooted, either by a native wind Or else by that from regions of Iarbas, Than I upraised at her command my chin; And when she by the beard the face demanded, Well I perceived the venom of her meaning. And as my countenance was lifted up, Mine eye perceived those creatures beautiful Had rested from the strewing of the flowers; And, still but little reassured, mine eyes Saw Beatrice turned round towards the monster, That is one person only in two natures. Beneath her veil, beyond the margent green, She seemed to me far more her ancient self To excel, than others here, when she was here. So pricked me then the thorn of penitence, That of all other things the one which turned me Most to its love became the most my foe. Such self-conviction stung me at the heart O'erpowered I fell, and what I then became She knoweth who had furnished me the cause. Then, when the heart restored my outward sense, The lady I had found alone, above me I saw, and she was saying, \"Hold me, hold me.\" Up to my throat she in the stream had drawn me, And, dragging me behind her, she was moving Upon the water lightly as a shuttle. When I was near unto the blessed shore, \"Asperges me,\" I heard so sweetly sung, Remember it I cannot, much less write it. The beautiful lady opened wide her arms, Embraced my head, and plunged me underneath, Where I was forced to swallow of the water. Then forth she drew me, and all dripping brought Into the dance of the four beautiful, And each one with her arm did cover me. 'We here are Nymphs, and in the Heaven are stars; Ere Beatrice descended to the world, We as her handmaids were appointed her. We'll lead thee to her eyes; but for the pleasant 277 \nLight that within them is, shall sharpen thine The three beyond, who more profoundly look.' Thus singing they began; and afterwards Unto the Griffin's breast they led me with them, Where Beatrice was standing, turned towards us. \"See that thou dost not spare thine eyes,\" they said; \"Before the emeralds have we stationed thee, Whence Love aforetime drew for thee his weapons.\" A thousand longings, hotter than the flame, Fastened mine eyes upon those eyes relucent, That still upon the Griffin steadfast stayed. As in a glass the sun, not otherwise Within them was the twofold monster shining, Now with the one, now with the other nature. Think, Reader, if within myself I marvelled, When I beheld the thing itself stand still, And in its image it transformed itself. While with amazement filled and jubilant, My soul was tasting of the food, that while It satisfies us makes us hunger for it, Themselves revealing of the highest rank In bearing, did the other three advance, Singing to their angelic saraband. \"Turn, Beatrice, O turn thy holy eyes,\" Such was their song, \"unto thy faithful one, Who has to see thee ta'en so many steps. In grace do us the grace that thou unveil Thy face to him, so that he may discern The second beauty which thou dost conceal.\" O splendour of the living light eternal! Who underneath the shadow of Parnassus Has grown so pale, or drunk so at its cistern, He would not seem to have his mind encumbered Striving to paint thee as thou didst appear, Where the harmonious heaven o'ershadowed thee, When in the open air thou didst unveil? 278",
      "modern": "\"You who stand beyond the sacred river,\"\nshe said, turning toward me the sharp point\nof words that even sideways had cut deep,\n\ncontinuing without pause: \"Speak now, speak—\nis this true? Such an accusation \ndemands your own confession joined to it.\"\n\nMy mind was thrown into such confusion\nthat my voice stirred but died before\nit could escape through lips and throat.\n\nShe waited briefly, then said: \"What are you thinking?\nAnswer me—your painful memories\nhave not yet been washed away by these waters.\"\n\nConfusion tangled with dismay\nforced such a feeble \"Yes\" from my mouth\nthat you'd need eyes to understand the sound.\n\nLike a crossbow that snaps when fired\nwith string and frame drawn far too tight,\nsending its arrow weakly to the mark,\n\nso I collapsed beneath that crushing weight,\nbursting into a flood of tears and sighs,\nmy voice failing as it tried to form.\n\nThen she said: \"In those desires of mine\nthat led you to love the highest good—\nbeyond which nothing greater can be sought—\n\nwhat ditches did you find blocking your path,\nwhat chains did you discover\nthat you stripped yourself of hope to pass beyond?\n\nWhat attractions, what advantages\ndid you see written on the faces of others\nthat made you turn your steps toward them?\"\n\nAfter heaving one bitter sigh,\nI barely found voice enough to answer,\nmy lips struggling to shape the words.\n\nWeeping, I said: \"The things right before me,\nwith their false pleasures, led my steps astray\nthe moment your face was hidden from me.\"\n\nShe replied: \"If you stayed silent or denied\nwhat you confess, your guilt would be no less visible—\nit's known by such a Judge as this.\n\nBut when the accusation of sin\nbursts forth from one's own lips,\nin our court the grinding wheel turns back against the blade.\n\nStill, so you may bear greater shame\nfor your transgression, and next time\nbe stronger when you hear the Sirens' song,\n\ncast aside this seed of weeping and listen—\nyou'll hear how my buried flesh\nshould have guided you the opposite way.\n\nNever did art or nature offer you\npleasure as great as the beautiful body\nthat once enclosed me, now scattered in earth.\n\nIf that highest pleasure failed you\nthrough my death, what mortal thing\nshould then have drawn you into its desire?\n\nAt the very first arrow shot\nby deceptive things, you should have risen up\nto follow me, who was no longer such.\n\nYou should not have bent your wings downward\nto wait for more wounds—whether from some girl\nor other vanity of such brief worth.\n\nThe young bird waits for two or three shots,\nbut before the eyes of those full-grown,\nnets are spread and arrows shot in vain.\"\n\nLike children standing silent in their shame,\neyes fixed on the ground,\naware of their fault and truly sorry—\n\nthat's how I stood. She said: \"Since hearing\ncauses you such pain, lift up your chin\nand you'll feel greater pain in seeing.\"\n\nA mighty oak is uprooted with less resistance,\nwhether by wind from home\nor from the lands of North Africa,\n\nthan I raised my face at her command.\nWhen she called for my face by naming my beard,\nI caught the full venom of her meaning.\n\nAs my face lifted up,\nmy eyes saw those beautiful creatures\nhad stopped scattering their flowers.\n\nStill barely reassured, my eyes\nsaw Beatrice turned toward the beast\nthat is one person in two natures.\n\nBeneath her veil, beyond the green margin,\nshe seemed to surpass her former self\nmore than she had surpassed all others when alive.\n\nThe thorn of remorse pierced me so sharply then\nthat whatever had most turned me to its love\nbecame the thing I hated most.\n\nSuch self-knowledge stung my heart—\nI collapsed, overcome. What I became then\nis known to her who caused it.\n\nWhen my heart restored my outward senses,\nI saw above me the lady I had found alone,\nsaying, \"Hold on to me, hold on.\"\n\nShe had drawn me into the stream up to my throat,\nand pulling me behind her, moved\nacross the water light as a shuttle.\n\nWhen I neared the blessed shore,\nI heard \"Cleanse me\" sung so sweetly\nI cannot remember it, much less write it down.\n\nThe beautiful lady opened her arms wide,\nembraced my head, and plunged me under\nwhere I was forced to swallow the water.\n\nThen she pulled me out and brought me, dripping,\ninto the dance of the four beautiful ones—\neach covering me with her arm.\n\n\"Here we are nymphs, in heaven we are stars.\nBefore Beatrice descended to the world,\nwe were appointed as her handmaids.\n\nWe'll bring you to her eyes, but the three beyond,\nwho see more deeply, will sharpen yours\nfor the joyful light that shines within them.\"\n\nSinging this way, they began, then led me\nto the griffin's breast,\nwhere Beatrice stood facing us.\n\n\"See that you don't spare your eyes,\" they said.\n\"We've placed you before the emeralds\nfrom which Love once drew his weapons aimed at you.\"\n\nA thousand desires, hotter than flame,\nfixed my eyes on those shining eyes\nthat stayed steady on the griffin.\n\nLike the sun reflected in a mirror,\nthe double-natured creature shone within them,\nsometimes showing one nature, sometimes the other.\n\nThink, reader, how amazed I was\nto see the thing itself standing still\nwhile transforming in its reflection.\n\nAs my soul, filled with wonder and joy,\ntasted that food which satisfies\nyet makes us hunger for more,\n\nthe other three, revealing by their bearing\nthey were of the highest rank,\ncame forward dancing to their angelic song:\n\n\"Turn, Beatrice, turn your holy eyes\ntoward your faithful one\nwho has taken so many steps to see you.\n\nDo us the grace to unveil\nyour face to him, so he may see\nthe second beauty you keep hidden.\"\n\nO splendor of eternal living light!\nWho has grown so pale beneath Parnassus' shadow,\nor drunk so deeply from its spring,\n\nthat his mind would not seem overwhelmed\ntrying to paint you as you appeared\nwhen harmonious heaven cast its shade over you\n\nand you unveiled yourself in the open air?",

      "original": "The Tree of Knowledge. Allegory of the Chariot. So steadfast and attentive were mine eyes In satisfying their decennial thirst, That all my other senses were extinct, And upon this side and on that they had Walls of indifference, so the holy smile Drew them unto itself with the old net When forcibly my sight was turned away Towards my left hand by those goddesses, Because I heard from them a \"Too intently!\" And that condition of the sight which is In eyes but lately smitten by the sun Bereft me of my vision some short while; But to the less when sight re-shaped itself, I say the less in reference to the greater Splendour from which perforce I had withdrawn, I saw upon its right wing wheeled about The glorious host returning with the sun And with the sevenfold flames upon their faces. As underneath its shields, to save itself, A squadron turns, and with its banner wheels, Before the whole thereof can change its front, That soldiery of the celestial kingdom Which marched in the advance had wholly passed us Before the chariot had turned its pole. Then to the wheels the maidens turned themselves, And the Griffin moved his burden benedight, But so that not a feather of him fluttered. The lady fair who drew me through the ford Followed with Statius and myself the wheel Which made its orbit with the lesser arc. 279 So passing through the lofty forest, vacant By fault of her who in the serpent trusted, Angelic music made our steps keep time. Perchance as great a space had in three flights An arrow loosened from the string o'erpassed, As we had moved when Beatrice descended. I heard them murmur altogether, \"Adam!\" Then circled they about a tree despoiled Of blooms and other leafage on each bough. Its tresses, which so much the more dilate As higher they ascend, had been by Indians Among their forests marvelled at for height. \"Blessed art thou, O Griffin, who dost not Pluck with thy beak these branches sweet to taste, Since appetite by this was turned to evil.\" After this fashion round the tree robust The others shouted; and the twofold creature: \"Thus is preserved the seed of all the just.\" And turning to the pole which he had dragged, He drew it close beneath the widowed bough, And what was of it unto it left bound. In the same manner as our trees (when downward Falls the great light, with that together mingled Which after the celestial Lasca shines) Begin to swell, and then renew themselves, Each one with its own colour, ere the Sun Harness his steeds beneath another star: Less than of rose and more than violet A hue disclosing, was renewed the tree That had erewhile its boughs so desolate. I never heard, nor here below is sung, The hymn which afterward that people sang, Nor did I bear the melody throughout. Had I the power to paint how fell asleep Those eyes compassionless, of Syrinx hearing, Those eyes to which more watching cost so dear, Even as a painter who from model paints I would portray how I was lulled asleep; He may, who well can picture drowsihood. Therefore I pass to what time I awoke, 280 \nAnd say a splendour rent from me the veil Of slumber, and a calling: \"Rise, what dost thou?\" As to behold the apple-tree in blossom Which makes the Angels greedy for its fruit, And keeps perpetual bridals in the Heaven, Peter and John and James conducted were, And, overcome, recovered at the word By which still greater slumbers have been broken, And saw their school diminished by the loss Not only of Elias, but of Moses, And the apparel of their Master changed; So I revived, and saw that piteous one Above me standing, who had been conductress Aforetime of my steps beside the river, And all in doubt I said, \"Where's Beatrice?\" And she: \"Behold her seated underneath The leafage new, upon the root of it. Behold the company that circles her; The rest behind the Griffin are ascending With more melodious song, and more profound.\" And if her speech were more diffuse I know not, Because already in my sight was she Who from the hearing of aught else had shut me. Alone she sat upon the very earth, Left there as guardian of the chariot Which I had seen the biform monster fasten. Encircling her, a cloister made themselves The seven Nymphs, with those lights in their hands Which are secure from Aquilon and Auster. \"Short while shalt thou be here a forester, And thou shalt be with me for evermore A citizen of that Rome where Christ is Roman. Therefore, for that world's good which liveth ill, Fix on the car thine eyes, and what thou seest, Having returned to earth, take heed thou write.\" Thus Beatrice; and I, who at the feet Of her commandments all devoted was, My mind and eyes directed where she willed. Never descended with so swift a motion Fire from a heavy cloud, when it is raining 281 \nFrom out the region which is most remote, As I beheld the bird of Jove descend Down through the tree, rending away the bark, As well as blossoms and the foliage new, And he with all his might the chariot smote, Whereat it reeled, like vessel in a tempest Tossed by the waves, now starboard and now larboard. Thereafter saw I leap into the body Of the triumphal vehicle a Fox, That seemed unfed with any wholesome food. But for his hideous sins upbraiding him, My Lady put him to as swift a flight As such a fleshless skeleton could bear. Then by the way that it before had come, Into the chariot's chest I saw the Eagle Descend, and leave it feathered with his plumes. And such as issues from a heart that mourns, A voice from Heaven there issued, and it said: \"My little bark, how badly art thou freighted!\" Methought, then, that the earth did yawn between Both wheels, and I saw rise from it a Dragon, Who through the chariot upward fixed his tail, And as a wasp that draweth back its sting, Drawing unto himself his tail malign, Drew out the floor, and went his way rejoicing. That which remained behind, even as with grass A fertile region, with the feathers, offered Perhaps with pure intention and benign, Reclothed itself, and with them were reclothed The pole and both the wheels so speedily, A sigh doth longer keep the lips apart. Transfigured thus the holy edifice Thrust forward heads upon the parts of it, Three on the pole and one at either corner. The first were horned like oxen; but the four Had but a single horn upon the forehead; A monster such had never yet been seen! Firm as a rock upon a mountain high, Seated upon it, there appeared to me A shameless whore, with eyes swift glancing round, 282 \nAnd, as if not to have her taken from him, Upright beside her I beheld a giant; And ever and anon they kissed each other. But because she her wanton, roving eye Turned upon me, her angry paramour Did scourge her from her head unto her feet. Then full of jealousy, and fierce with wrath, He loosed the monster, and across the forest Dragged it so far, he made of that alone A shield unto the whore and the strange beast. 283",

But when the other virgins place had given For her to speak, uprisen to her feet With colour as of fire, she made response: \"'Modicum, et non videbitis me; Et iterum,' my sisters predilect, 'Modicum, et vos videbitis me.'\" Then all the seven in front of her she placed; And after her, by beckoning only, moved Me and the lady and the sage who stayed. So she moved onward; and I do not think That her tenth step was placed upon the ground, When with her eyes upon mine eyes she smote, And with a tranquil aspect, \"Come more quickly,\" To me she said, \"that, if I speak with thee, To listen to me thou mayst be well placed.\" As soon as I was with her as I should be, She said to me: \"Why, brother, dost thou not Venture to question now, in coming with me?\" As unto those who are too reverential, Speaking in presence of superiors, Who drag no living utterance to their teeth, It me befell, that without perfect sound Began I: \"My necessity, Madonna, 284 You know, and that which thereunto is good.\" And she to me: \"Of fear and bashfulness Henceforward I will have thee strip thyself, So that thou speak no more as one who dreams. Know that the vessel which the serpent broke Was, and is not; but let him who is guilty Think that God's vengeance does not fear a sop. Without an heir shall not for ever be The Eagle that left his plumes upon the car, Whence it became a monster, then a prey; For verily I see, and hence narrate it, The stars already near to bring the time, From every hindrance safe, and every bar, Within which a Five-hundred, Ten, and Five, One sent from God, shall slay the thievish woman And that same giant who is sinning with her. And peradventure my dark utterance, Like Themis and the Sphinx, may less persuade thee, Since, in their mode, it clouds the intellect; But soon the facts shall be the Naiades Who shall this difficult enigma solve, Without destruction of the flocks and harvests. Note thou; and even as by me are uttered These words, so teach them unto those who live That life which is a running unto death; And bear in mind, whene'er thou writest them, Not to conceal what thou hast seen the plant, That twice already has been pillaged here. Whoever pillages or shatters it, With blasphemy of deed offendeth God, Who made it holy for his use alone. For biting that, in pain and in desire Five thousand years and more the first-born soul Craved Him, who punished in himself the bite. Thy genius slumbers, if it deem it not For special reason so pre-eminent In height, and so inverted in its summit. And if thy vain imaginings had not been Water of Elsa round about thy mind, And Pyramus to the mulberry, their pleasure, 285 \nThou by so many circumstances only The justice of the interdict of God Morally in the tree wouldst recognize. But since I see thee in thine intellect Converted into stone and stained with sin, So that the light of my discourse doth daze thee, I will too, if not written, at least painted, Thou bear it back within thee, for the reason That cinct with palm the pilgrim's staff is borne.\" And I: \"As by a signet is the wax Which does not change the figure stamped upon it, My brain is now imprinted by yourself. But wherefore so beyond my power of sight Soars your desirable discourse, that aye The more I strive, so much the more I lose it?\" \"That thou mayst recognize,\" she said, \"the school Which thou hast followed, and mayst see how far Its doctrine follows after my discourse, And mayst behold your path from the divine Distant as far as separated is From earth the heaven that highest hastens on.\" Whence her I answered: \"I do not remember That ever I estranged myself from you, Nor have I conscience of it that reproves me.\" \"And if thou art not able to remember,\" Smiling she answered, \"recollect thee now That thou this very day hast drunk of Lethe; And if from smoke a fire may be inferred, Such an oblivion clearly demonstrates Some error in thy will elsewhere intent. Truly from this time forward shall my words Be naked, so far as it is befitting To lay them open unto thy rude gaze.\" And more coruscant and with slower steps The sun was holding the meridian circle, Which, with the point of view, shifts here and there When halted (as he cometh to a halt, Who goes before a squadron as its escort, If something new he find upon his way) The ladies seven at a dark shadow's edge, 286 \nSuch as, beneath green leaves and branches black, The Alp upon its frigid border wears. In front of them the Tigris and Euphrates Methought I saw forth issue from one fountain, And slowly part, like friends, from one another. \"O light, O glory of the human race! What stream is this which here unfolds itself From out one source, and from itself withdraws?\" For such a prayer, 'twas said unto me, \"Pray Matilda that she tell thee;\" and here answered, As one does who doth free himself from blame, The beautiful lady: \"This and other things Were told to him by me; and sure I am The water of Lethe has not hid them from him.\" And Beatrice: \"Perhaps a greater care, Which oftentimes our memory takes away, Has made the vision of his mind obscure. But Eunoe behold, that yonder rises; Lead him to it, and, as thou art accustomed, Revive again the half-dead virtue in him.\" Like gentle soul, that maketh no excuse, But makes its own will of another's will As soon as by a sign it is disclosed, Even so, when she had taken hold of me, The beautiful lady moved, and unto Statius Said, in her womanly manner, \"Come with him.\" If, Reader, I possessed a longer space For writing it, I yet would sing in part Of the sweet draught that ne'er would satiate me; But inasmuch as full are all the leaves Made ready for this second canticle, The curb of art no farther lets me go. From the most holy water I returned Regenerate, in the manner of new trees That are renewed with a new foliage, Pure and disposed to mount unto the stars. 287 \nPart 3 Paradiso 288",
      "modern": "\"The nations have come, O God,\" alternating\n\nNow three voices, now four, the maidens began their melodious psalm\nthrough tears, and Beatrice listened to them,\ncompassionate and sighing, with such a face\nthat Mary was scarcely more transformed at the cross.\n\nBut when the other virgins gave her space to speak,\nshe rose to her feet, her color like fire,\nand made this response:\n\"A little while, and you will not see me;\nand again, my beloved sisters,\na little while, and you will see me.\"\n\nThen she placed all seven in front of her,\nand with a gesture alone, beckoned me to follow—\nme, and the lady, and the wise one who remained.\n\nSo she moved forward, and I don't think\nher tenth step had touched the ground\nwhen her eyes struck mine,\nand with a tranquil expression she said to me,\n\"Come more quickly, so that if I speak with you,\nyou'll be well positioned to listen.\"\n\nAs soon as I was beside her as I should be,\nshe said: \"Brother, why don't you dare\nto ask questions now, walking with me?\"\n\nLike those who are too reverent\nwhen speaking before their superiors,\nwho can't bring living words to their lips,\nso it happened to me—without clear sound\nI began: \"My lady, you know my need\nand what would be good for it.\"\n\nAnd she replied: \"From this moment forward\nI want you to strip yourself of fear and shame,\nso you no longer speak like someone dreaming.\n\nKnow that the vessel the serpent broke\nwas, and is not—but let the guilty one\nknow that God's vengeance fears no obstacle.\n\nThe Eagle that left its feathers on the chariot,\nmaking it first monster, then prey,\nwill not forever be without an heir.\n\nI see clearly, and therefore tell you:\nthe stars are already near to bring the time,\nsafe from every hindrance and barrier,\nwhen a Five Hundred, Ten, and Five—\none sent from God—will destroy the thieving woman\nand that giant who sins with her.\n\nPerhaps my dark prophecy,\nlike riddles of old, persuades you less\nbecause it clouds your understanding.\nBut soon events themselves will be the solution\nto this difficult enigma,\nwithout destroying flocks and harvests.\n\nTake note: just as I speak these words to you,\nteach them to those who live\nthat life which is a race toward death.\nAnd remember, when you write them down,\ndon't hide what you've seen of the tree\nthat has been despoiled twice in this place.\n\nWhoever plunders or breaks it\noffends God with blasphemous deed—\nHe who made it sacred for His use alone.\nFor tasting from it, the first soul\ncraved Him for more than five thousand years\nin pain and longing—Him who punished the bite in Himself.\n\nYour mind sleeps if it doesn't understand\nwhy the tree stands so supremely tall\nand inverted at its crown.\n\nIf your empty thoughts had not been\nlike mineral water clouding your mind,\nobscuring your vision like a stain,\nyou would recognize by these circumstances alone\nthe moral justice of God's prohibition of the tree.\n\nBut since I see your intellect\nturned to stone and darkened by guilt,\nso that the light of my words dazzles you,\nI want you to carry this back within you—\nif not written, at least imprinted—\nfor the same reason pilgrims bear palm-wrapped staffs.\"\n\nAnd I replied: \"Like wax that takes\nthe seal's impression without changing it,\nmy mind is now imprinted by you.\nBut why does your longed-for teaching\nsoar so far beyond my sight\nthat the more I strain, the more I lose it?\"\n\n\"So you may recognize,\" she said, \"the school\nyou've followed, and see how far\nits teaching falls behind my words,\nand understand that your path is as distant\nfrom the divine as the highest heaven\nis separated from earth.\"\n\nI answered her: \"I don't remember\never turning away from you,\nnor does my conscience reproach me for it.\"\n\n\"If you can't remember,\" she replied, smiling,\n\"then recall that today\nyou drank from Lethe's waters.\nJust as smoke reveals fire,\nthis forgetfulness clearly shows\nsome fault in your will, focused elsewhere.\n\nFrom now on my words will be unveiled,\nas much as is fitting\nto expose them to your untrained gaze.\"\n\nMore brilliant now and with slower steps,\nthe sun held the meridian circle\nthat shifts with the viewer's position,\nwhen the seven ladies stopped\nat the edge of a shadow dark\nas the Alps wear on their cold borders\nbeneath green leaves and black branches.\n\nBefore them I seemed to see\nTigris and Euphrates flowing from one spring,\nparting slowly like reluctant friends.\n\n\"O light, O glory of humankind,\nwhat river is this that spreads here\nfrom one source and then divides?\"\n\nAt my question, I was told,\n\"Ask Matilda to explain.\"\nThe beautiful lady answered\nlike someone clearing herself of blame:\n\"This and other things I told him,\nand I'm certain Lethe's waters haven't hidden them.\"\n\nBeatrice said: \"Perhaps some greater concern\nthat often steals our memory\nhas made his mind's vision dim.\nBut look—there rises Eunoe.\nLead him to it, and as you always do,\nrevive his half-dead power.\"\n\nLike a noble soul that makes no excuses\nbut adopts

      "original": "The glory of Him who moveth everything Doth penetrate the universe, and shine In one part more and in another less. Within that heaven which most his light receives Was I, and things beheld which to repeat Nor knows, nor can, who from above descends; Because in drawing near to its desire Our intellect ingulphs itself so far, That after it the memory cannot go. Truly whatever of the holy realm I had the power to treasure in my mind Shall now become the subject of my song. O good Apollo, for this last emprise Make of me such a vessel of thy power As giving the beloved laurel asks! One summit of Parnassus hitherto Has been enough for me, but now with both I needs must enter the arena left. Enter into my bosom, thou, and breathe As at the time when Marsyas thou didst draw Out of the scabbard of those limbs of his. O power divine, lend'st thou thyself to me So that the shadow of the blessed realm Stamped in my brain I can make manifest, Thou'lt see me come unto thy darling tree, And crown myself thereafter with those leaves Of which the theme and thou shall make me worthy. So seldom, Father, do we gather them For triumph or of Caesar or of Poet, (The fault and shame of human inclinations,) 289 That the Peneian foliage should bring forth Joy to the joyous Delphic deity, When any one it makes to thirst for it. A little spark is followed by great flame; Perchance with better voices after me Shall prayer be made that Cyrrha may respond! To mortal men by passages diverse Uprises the world's lamp; but by that one Which circles four uniteth with three crosses, With better course and with a better star Conjoined it issues, and the mundane wax Tempers and stamps more after its own fashion. Almost that passage had made morning there And evening here, and there was wholly white That hemisphere, and black the other part, When Beatrice towards the left-hand side I saw turned round, and gazing at the sun; Never did eagle fasten so upon it! And even as a second ray is wont To issue from the first and reascend, Like to a pilgrim who would fain return, Thus of her action, through the eyes infused In my imagination, mine I made, And sunward fixed mine eyes beyond our wont. There much is lawful which is here unlawful Unto our powers, by virtue of the place Made for the human species as its own. Not long I bore it, nor so little while But I beheld it sparkle round about Like iron that comes molten from the fire; And suddenly it seemed that day to day Was added, as if He who has the power Had with another sun the heaven adorned. With eyes upon the everlasting wheels Stood Beatrice all intent, and I, on her Fixing my vision from above removed, Such at her aspect inwardly became As Glaucus, tasting of the herb that made him Peer of the other gods beneath the sea. To represent transhumanise in words 290 \nImpossible were; the example, then, suffice Him for whom Grace the experience reserves. If I was merely what of me thou newly Createdst, Love who governest the heaven, Thou knowest, who didst lift me with thy light! When now the wheel, which thou dost make eternal Desiring thee, made me attentive to it By harmony thou dost modulate and measure, Then seemed to me so much of heaven enkindled By the sun's flame, that neither rain nor river E'er made a lake so widely spread abroad. The newness of the sound and the great light Kindled in me a longing for their cause, Never before with such acuteness felt; Whence she, who saw me as I saw myself, To quiet in me my perturbed mind, Opened her mouth, ere I did mine to ask, And she began: \"Thou makest thyself so dull With false imagining, that thou seest not What thou wouldst see if thou hadst shaken it off. Thou art not upon earth, as thou believest; But lightning, fleeing its appropriate site, Ne'er ran as thou, who thitherward returnest.\" If of my former doubt I was divested By these brief little words more smiled than spoken, I in a new one was the more ensnared; And said: \"Already did I rest content From great amazement; but am now amazed In what way I transcend these bodies light.\" Whereupon she, after a pitying sigh, Her eyes directed tow'rds me with that look A mother casts on a delirious child; And she began: \"All things whate'er they be Have order among themselves, and this is form, That makes the universe resemble God. Here do the higher creatures see the footprints Of the Eternal Power, which is the end Whereto is made the law already mentioned. In the order that I speak of are inclined All natures, by their destinies diverse, 291 \nMore or less near unto their origin; Hence they move onward unto ports diverse O'er the great sea of being; and each one With instinct given it which bears it on. This bears away the fire towards the moon; This is in mortal hearts the motive power This binds together and unites the earth. Nor only the created things that are Without intelligence this bow shoots forth, But those that have both intellect and love. The Providence that regulates all this Makes with its light the heaven forever quiet, Wherein that turns which has the greatest haste. And thither now, as to a site decreed, Bears us away the virtue of that cord Which aims its arrows at a joyous mark. True is it, that as oftentimes the form Accords not with the intention of the art, Because in answering is matter deaf, So likewise from this course doth deviate Sometimes the creature, who the power possesses, Though thus impelled, to swerve some other way, (In the same wise as one may see the fire Fall from a cloud,) if the first impetus Earthward is wrested by some false delight. Thou shouldst not wonder more, if well I judge, At thine ascent, than at a rivulet From some high mount descending to the lowland. Marvel it would be in thee, if deprived Of hindrance, thou wert seated down below, As if on earth the living fire were quiet.\" Thereat she heavenward turned again her face. 292",

second ray will spring\nfrom the first and rise again,\nlike a pilgrim eager to return home,\nso from her action, flowing through my eyes\ninto my imagination, I made mine,\nand fixed my gaze upon the

briefly\nthat I failed to see it sparkling all around\nlike iron emerging molten from the fire.\n\nAnd suddenly it seemed that day was added to day,\nas if He who has the power\nhad adorned heaven with another sun.\n\nBeatrice stood with eyes fixed\non the eternal wheels, and I,\nremoving my sight from above, fixed it on her.\nLooking at her, I became within\nwhat Glaucus became when he tasted the herb\nthat made him peer to the sea gods.\n\nTo put this transformation beyond human nature into words\nis impossible—let this example suffice\nfor those to whom grace reserves the experience.\n\nIf I was only what you newly created of me,\nLove that governs heaven,\nyou know, you who lifted me with your light.\nWhen the wheel that you make eternal\nthrough its desire for you caught my attention\nwith the harmony you tune and measure,\nso much of heaven seemed kindled\nby the sun's flame that no rain or river\never made a lake spread so wide.\n\nThe strangeness of the sound and the great light\nkindled in me a desire to know their cause,\nsharper than I had ever felt before.\nAnd she who saw me as I saw myself,\nto calm my troubled mind,\nopened her mouth before I opened mine to ask.\n\nShe began: \"You make yourself so dense\nwith false imagining that you cannot see\nwhat you would see if you cast it off.\nYou are not on earth as you believe,\nbut lightning fleeing from its proper sphere\nnever ran as fast as you, returning to your source.\"\n\nIf I was freed from my first doubt\nby these few words, more smiled than spoken,\nI found myself caught in a new perplexity.\nI said: \"I was already satisfied,\nreleased from great wonder, but now I wonder\nhow I can rise through these light bodies.\"\n\nAt this, after a pitying sigh,\nshe turned her eyes toward me with the look\na mother gives her delirious child.\nShe began: \"All things, whatever they may be,\nhave order among themselves, and this order is the form\nthat makes the universe resemble

The sea I sail has never yet been passed; Minerva breathes, and pilots me Apollo, And Muses nine point out to me the Bears. Ye other few who have the neck uplifted Betimes to th' bread of Angels upon which One liveth here and grows not sated by it, Well may you launch upon the deep salt-sea Your vessel, keeping still my wake before you Upon the water that grows smooth again. Those glorious ones who unto Colchos passed Were not so wonder-struck as you shall be, When Jason they beheld a ploughman made! The con-created and perpetual thirst For the realm deiform did bear us on, As swift almost as ye the heavens behold. Upward gazed Beatrice, and I at her; And in such space perchance as strikes a bolt And flies, and from the notch unlocks itself, Arrived I saw me where a wondrous thing Drew to itself my sight; and therefore she From whom no care of mine could be concealed, Towards me turning, blithe as beautiful, 293 Said unto me: \"Fix gratefully thy mind On God, who unto the first star has brought us.\" It seemed to me a cloud encompassed us, Luminous, dense, consolidate and bright As adamant on which the sun is striking. Into itself did the eternal pearl Receive us, even as water doth receive A ray of light, remaining still unbroken. If I was body, (and we here conceive not How one dimension tolerates another, Which needs must be if body enter body,) More the desire should be enkindled in us That essence to behold, wherein is seen How God and our own nature were united. There will be seen what we receive by faith, Not demonstrated, but self-evident In guise of the first truth that man believes. I made reply: \"Madonna, as devoutly As most I can do I give thanks to Him Who has removed me from the mortal world. But tell me what the dusky spots may be Upon this body, which below on earth Make people tell that fabulous tale of Cain?\" Somewhat she smiled; and then, \"If the opinion Of mortals be erroneous,\" she said, \"Where'er the key of sense doth not unlock, Certes, the shafts of wonder should not pierce thee Now, forasmuch as, following the senses, Thou seest that the reason has short wings. But tell me what thou think'st of it thyself.\" And I: \"What seems to us up here diverse, Is caused, I think, by bodies rare and dense.\" And she: \"Right truly shalt thou see immersed In error thy belief, if well thou hearest The argument that I shall make against it. Lights many the eighth sphere displays to you Which in their quality and quantity May noted be of aspects different. If this were caused by rare and dense alone, One only virtue would there be in all 294 \nOr more or less diffused, or equally. Virtues diverse must be perforce the fruits Of formal principles; and these, save one, Of course would by thy reasoning be destroyed. Besides, if rarity were of this dimness The cause thou askest, either through and through This planet thus attenuate were of matter, Or else, as in a body is apportioned The fat and lean, so in like manner this Would in its volume interchange the leaves. Were it the former, in the sun's eclipse It would be manifest by the shining through Of light, as through aught tenuous interfused. This is not so; hence we must scan the other, And if it chance the other I demolish, Then falsified will thy opinion be. But if this rarity go not through and through, There needs must be a limit, beyond which Its contrary prevents the further passing, And thence the foreign radiance is reflected, Even as a colour cometh back from glass, The which behind itself concealeth lead. Now thou wilt say the sunbeam shows itself More dimly there than in the other parts, By being there reflected farther back. From this reply experiment will free thee If e'er thou try it, which is wont to be The fountain to the rivers of your arts. Three mirrors shalt thou take, and two remove Alike from thee, the other more remote Between the former two shall meet thine eyes. Turned towards these, cause that behind thy back Be placed a light, illuming the three mirrors And coming back to thee by all reflected. Though in its quantity be not so ample The image most remote, there shalt thou see How it perforce is equally resplendent. Now, as beneath the touches of warm rays Naked the subject of the snow remains Both of its former colour and its cold, 295 \nThee thus remaining in thy intellect, Will I inform with such a living light, That it shall tremble in its aspect to thee. Within the heaven of the divine repose Revolves a body, in whose virtue lies The being of whatever it contains. The following heaven, that has so many eyes, Divides this being by essences diverse, Distinguished from it, and by it contained. The other spheres, by various differences, All the distinctions which they have within them Dispose unto their ends and their effects. Thus do these organs of the world proceed, As thou perceivest now, from grade to grade; Since from above they take, and act beneath. Observe me well, how through this place I come Unto the truth thou wishest, that hereafter Thou mayst alone know how to keep the ford The power and motion of the holy spheres, As from the artisan the hammer's craft, Forth from the blessed motors must proceed. The heaven, which lights so manifold make fair, From the Intelligence profound, which turns it, The image takes, and makes of it a seal. And even as the soul within your dust Through members different and accommodated To faculties diverse expands itself, So likewise this Intelligence diffuses Its virtue multiplied among the stars. Itself revolving on its unity. Virtue diverse doth a diverse alloyage Make with the precious body that it quickens, In which, as life in you, it is combined. From the glad nature whence it is derived, The mingled virtue through the body shines, Even as gladness through the living pupil. From this proceeds whate'er from light to light Appeareth different, not from dense and rare: This is the formal principle that produces, According to its goodness, dark and bright.\" 296",

follows only the senses.\nBut tell me what you think about it yourself.\"\n\nAnd I said: \"What appears different to us here\nis caused, I believe, by matter that is rare or dense.\"\n\n\"You will see your belief truly drowned in error,\"\nshe replied, \"if you listen carefully\nto the argument I will make against it.\n\nThe eighth sphere displays many lights to you\nwhich can be noted as different\nin both quality and quantity.\nIf rare and dense matter alone caused this,\nthen only one power would exist in all of them—\ndistributed more or less, or equally.\n\nDifferent powers must come from different\nformal principles, and all but one of these\nwould be destroyed by your reasoning.\n\nBesides, if rarity caused the dimness you ask about,\nthen either this planet would be thin with matter\nall the way through,\nor else, as fat and lean alternate in a body,\nthis sphere would alternate its layers similarly.\n\nIf the first were true, it would show\nduring a solar eclipse\nby light shining through\nas it does through anything thin.\nThis doesn't happen, so we must examine the second option—\nand if I demolish that one too,\nyour opinion will be proven false.\n\nIf this rarity didn't go all the way through,\nthere would have to be a boundary\nbeyond which its opposite\nprevents further passage,\nand from there foreign light would be reflected back\njust as color returns from glass\nthat conceals lead behind it.\n\nNow you might say the sunbeam appears\ndimmer there than in other parts\nbecause it's reflected from farther back.\nBut experiment can free you from this reply—\nyou should try it, since experiment\nis the source of your sciences.\n\nTake three mirrors and place two\nat equal distances from you,\nwith the third farther back between them.\nTurn toward these mirrors and place\na light behind your back\nto illuminate all three\nand reflect back to you.\nThough the most distant image\nwon't be as large,\nyou'll see it shines with equal brightness.\n\nNow, just as the foundation of snow,\nwhen touched by warm rays,\nis left bare of both\nits former color and its coldness,\nso you, left bare in your understanding,\nI will inform with such living light\nthat it will sparkle as you look at it.\n\nWithin the heaven of divine peace\nrevolves a sphere in whose power lies\nthe existence of everything it contains.\nThe following heaven, with its many stars,\ndivides this existence among diverse essences\nthat are separate from it yet contained within it.\nThe other spheres, through various differences,\ndirect all their internal distinctions\ntoward their purposes and effects.\n\nThese organs of the universe proceed,\nas you now see, from level to level,\nreceiving from above and acting below.\n\nWatch carefully how I move through this place\ntoward the truth you seek, so that afterward\nyou can navigate these waters alone.\n\nThe power and motion of the sacred spheres\nmust flow from their blessed movers\nlike skill flows from the craftsman to the hammer.\nThe heaven made beautiful by so many lights\ntakes its image from the deep Intelligence that turns it\nand makes itself a seal of that image.\n\nJust as the soul spreads itself through your flesh\nvia different organs adapted\nto different faculties,\nso this Intelligence diffuses\nits multiplied power among the stars\nwhile revolving in its unity.\n\nEach different power makes a different compound\nwith the precious body it animates,\nbinding with it as life binds with you.\nFrom the joyful nature from which it flows,\nthis mingled power shines through the body\nlike happiness shining through a living eye.\n\nFrom this comes whatever appears different\nfrom light to light—\nnot from dense and rare matter.\nThis is the formal principle that produces,\naccording to its excellence, the dark and bright.\"",

      "original": "That Sun, which erst with love my bosom warmed, Of beauteous truth had unto me discovered, By proving and reproving, the sweet aspect. And, that I might confess myself convinced And confident, so far as was befitting, I lifted more erect my head to speak. But there appeared a vision, which withdrew me So close to it, in order to be seen, That my confession I remembered not. Such as through polished and transparent glass, Or waters crystalline and undisturbed, But not so deep as that their bed be lost, Come back again the outlines of our faces So feeble, that a pearl on forehead white Comes not less speedily unto our eyes; Such saw I many faces prompt to speak, So that I ran in error opposite To that which kindled love 'twixt man and fountain. As soon as I became aware of them, Esteeming them as mirrored semblances, To see of whom they were, mine eyes I turned, And nothing saw, and once more turned them forward Direct into the light of my sweet Guide, Who smiling kindled in her holy eyes. \"Marvel thou not,\" she said to me, \"because I smile at this thy puerile conceit, Since on the truth it trusts not yet its foot, But turns thee, as 'tis wont, on emptiness. True substances are these which thou beholdest, Here relegate for breaking of some vow. 297 Therefore speak with them, listen and believe; For the true light, which giveth peace to them, Permits them not to turn from it their feet.\" And I unto the shade that seemed most wishful To speak directed me, and I began, As one whom too great eagerness bewilders: \"O well-created spirit, who in the rays Of life eternal dost the sweetness taste Which being untasted ne'er is comprehended, Grateful 'twill be to me, if thou content me Both with thy name and with your destiny.\" Whereat she promptly and with laughing eyes: \"Our charity doth never shut the doors Against a just desire, except as one Who wills that all her court be like herself. I was a virgin sister in the world; And if thy mind doth contemplate me well, The being more fair will not conceal me from thee, But thou shalt recognise I am Piccarda, Who, stationed here among these other blessed, Myself am blessed in the slowest sphere. All our affections, that alone inflamed Are in the pleasure of the Holy Ghost, Rejoice at being of his order formed; And this allotment, which appears so low, Therefore is given us, because our vows Have been neglected and in some part void.\" Whence I to her: \"In your miraculous aspects There shines I know not what of the divine, Which doth transform you from our first conceptions. Therefore I was not swift in my remembrance; But what thou tellest me now aids me so, That the refiguring is easier to me. But tell me, ye who in this place are happy, Are you desirous of a higher place, To see more or to make yourselves more friends?\" First with those other shades she smiled a little; Thereafter answered me so full of gladness, She seemed to burn in the first fire of love: \"Brother, our will is quieted by virtue 298 \nOf charity, that makes us wish alone For what we have, nor gives us thirst for more. If to be more exalted we aspired, Discordant would our aspirations be Unto the will of Him who here secludes us; Which thou shalt see finds no place in these circles, If being in charity is needful here, And if thou lookest well into its nature; Nay, 'tis essential to this blest existence To keep itself within the will divine, Whereby our very wishes are made one; So that, as we are station above station Throughout this realm, to all the realm 'tis pleasing, As to the King, who makes his will our will. And his will is our peace; this is the sea To which is moving onward whatsoever It doth create, and all that nature makes.\" Then it was clear to me how everywhere In heaven is Paradise, although the grace Of good supreme there rain not in one measure. But as it comes to pass, if one food sates, And for another still remains the longing, We ask for this, and that decline with thanks, E'en thus did I; with gesture and with word, To learn from her what was the web wherein She did not ply the shuttle to the end. \"A perfect life and merit high in-heaven A lady o'er us,\" said she, \"by whose rule Down in your world they vest and veil themselves, That until death they may both watch and sleep Beside that Spouse who every vow accepts Which charity conformeth to his pleasure. To follow her, in girlhood from the world I fled, and in her habit shut myself, And pledged me to the pathway of her sect. Then men accustomed unto evil more Than unto good, from the sweet cloister tore me; God knows what afterward my life became. This other splendour, which to thee reveals Itself on my right side, and is enkindled 299 \nWith all the illumination of our sphere, What of myself I say applies to her; A nun was she, and likewise from her head Was ta'en the shadow of the sacred wimple. But when she too was to the world returned Against her wishes and against good usage, Of the heart's veil she never was divested. Of great Costanza this is the effulgence, Who from the second wind of Suabia Brought forth the third and latest puissance.\" Thus unto me she spake, and then began \"Ave Maria\" singing, and in singing Vanished, as through deep water something heavy. My sight, that followed her as long a time As it was possible, when it had lost her Turned round unto the mark of more desire, And wholly unto Beatrice reverted; But she such lightnings flashed into mine eyes, That at the first my sight endured it not; And this in questioning more backward made me. 300",

me,\n\"that I smile at your childish mistake.\nYou still don't trust your foot upon the truth\nbut turn, as usual, toward emptiness.\nThese are true souls that you behold,\nexiled here for breaking

      "original": "Between two viands, equally removed And tempting, a free man would die of hunger Ere either he could bring unto his teeth. So would a lamb between the ravenings Of two fierce wolves stand fearing both alike; And so would stand a dog between two does. Hence, if I held my peace, myself I blame not, Impelled in equal measure by my doubts, Since it must be so, nor do I commend. I held my peace; but my desire was painted Upon my face, and questioning with that More fervent far than by articulate speech. Beatrice did as Daniel had done Relieving Nebuchadnezzar from the wrath Which rendered him unjustly merciless, And said: \"Well see I how attracteth thee One and the other wish, so that thy care Binds itself so that forth it does not breathe. Thou arguest, if good will be permanent, The violence of others, for what reason Doth it decrease the measure of my merit? Again for doubting furnish thee occasion Souls seeming to return unto the stars, According to the sentiment of Plato. These are the questions which upon thy wish Are thrusting equally; and therefore first Will I treat that which hath the most of gall. He of the Seraphim most absorbed in God, Moses, and Samuel, and whichever John Thou mayst select, I say, and even Mary, 301 Have not in any other heaven their seats, Than have those spirits that just appeared to thee, Nor of existence more or fewer years; But all make beautiful the primal circle, And have sweet life in different degrees, By feeling more or less the eternal breath. They showed themselves here, not because allotted This sphere has been to them, but to give sign Of the celestial which is least exalted. To speak thus is adapted to your mind, Since only through the sense it apprehendeth What then it worthy makes of intellect. On this account the Scripture condescends Unto your faculties, and feet and hands To God attributes, and means something else; And Holy Church under an aspect human Gabriel and Michael represent to you, And him who made Tobias whole again. That which Timaeus argues of the soul Doth not resemble that which here is seen, Because it seems that as he speaks he thinks. He says the soul unto its star returns, Believing it to have been severed thence Whenever nature gave it as a form. Perhaps his doctrine is of other guise Than the words sound, and possibly may be With meaning that is not to be derided. If he doth mean that to these wheels return The honour of their influence and the blame, Perhaps his bow doth hit upon some truth. This principle ill understood once warped The whole world nearly, till it went astray Invoking Jove and Mercury and Mars. The other doubt which doth disquiet thee Less venom has, for its malevolence Could never lead thee otherwhere from me. That as unjust our justice should appear In eyes of mortals, is an argument Of faith, and not of sin heretical. But still, that your perception may be able 302 \nTo thoroughly penetrate this verity, As thou desirest, I will satisfy thee. If it be violence when he who suffers Co-operates not with him who uses force, These souls were not on that account excused; For will is never quenched unless it will, But operates as nature doth in fire If violence a thousand times distort it. Hence, if it yieldeth more or less, it seconds The force; and these have done so, having power Of turning back unto the holy place. If their will had been perfect, like to that Which Lawrence fast upon his gridiron held, And Mutius made severe to his own hand, It would have urged them back along the road Whence they were dragged, as soon as they were free; But such a solid will is all too rare. And by these words, if thou hast gathered them As thou shouldst do, the argument is refuted That would have still annoyed thee many times. But now another passage runs across Before thine eyes, and such that by thyself Thou couldst not thread it ere thou wouldst be weary. I have for certain put into thy mind That soul beatified could never lie, For it is near the primal Truth, And then thou from Piccarda might'st have heard Costanza kept affection for the veil, So that she seemeth here to contradict me. Many times, brother, has it come to pass, That, to escape from peril, with reluctance That has been done it was not right to do, E'en as Alcmaeon (who, being by his father Thereto entreated, his own mother slew) Not to lose pity pitiless became. At this point I desire thee to remember That force with will commingles, and they cause That the offences cannot be excused. Will absolute consenteth not to evil; But in so far consenteth as it fears, 303 \nIf it refrain, to fall into more harm. Hence when Piccarda uses this expression, She meaneth the will absolute, and I The other, so that both of us speak truth.\" Such was the flowing of the holy river That issued from the fount whence springs all truth; This put to rest my wishes one and all. \"O love of the first lover, O divine,\" Said I forthwith, \"whose speech inundates me And warms me so, it more and more revives me, My own affection is not so profound As to suffice in rendering grace for grace; Let Him, who sees and can, thereto respond. Well I perceive that never sated is Our intellect unless the Truth illume it, Beyond which nothing true expands itself. It rests therein, as wild beast in his lair, When it attains it; and it can attain it; If not, then each desire would frustrate be. Therefore springs up, in fashion of a shoot, Doubt at the foot of truth; and this is nature, Which to the top from height to height impels us. This doth invite me, this assurance give me With reverence, Lady, to inquire of you Another truth, which is obscure to me. I wish to know if man can satisfy you For broken vows with other good deeds, so That in your balance they will not be light.\" Beatrice gazed upon me with her eyes Full of the sparks of love, and so divine, That, overcome my power, I turned my back And almost lost myself with eyes downcast. 304",
      "modern": "Between two equally distant meals,\nboth equally tempting,\na free man would starve to death\nbefore he could bring either to his mouth.\n\nA lamb would freeze the same way\nbetween two ravenous wolves,\nfearing both equally.\nA dog would stand just as paralyzed\nbetween two deer.\n\nSo it is—\n\nI cannot blame myself for staying silent,\npulled equally by conflicting doubts—\nsince it must be this way, I don't condemn myself either.\nI held my peace, but my longing was written\nacross my face, my questioning burned there\nfar more intensely than any spoken words could show.\n\nBeatrice acted as Daniel once had,\nfreeing Nebuchadnezzar from the rage\nthat made him cruel beyond all justice,\nand she said: \"I see clearly how both desires\npull at you, so your worry binds itself\nso tightly that it cannot find its breath.\n\nYou argue: if good will remains constant,\nwhy should another's violence reduce\nthe measure of my merit in any way?\nAnd here's another doubt to trouble you—\nsouls that seem to return unto the stars,\nfollowing Plato's ancient reasoning.\n\nThese questions press equally upon your mind,\nso first I'll address the one with deeper sting.\nThe seraph most absorbed in God's presence,\nMoses, Samuel, whichever John you choose,\neven Mary herself—none of them\nhave seats in any heaven different\n\nfrom these spirits who just appeared to you,\nnor do they possess more or fewer years.\nThey all make beautiful that highest sphere\nand live in sweetness at different levels,\nfeeling the eternal breath in varying degrees.\nThey showed themselves here not because\n\nthis sphere was given to them as their place,\nbut to signal the celestial realm\nthat stands at the lowest level of heaven.\nThis way of speaking fits your human mind,\nsince only through the senses can you grasp\nwhat you then make worthy of understanding.\n\nFor this reason Scripture condescends\nto your capacities, giving God feet and hands\nwhile meaning something else entirely.\nHoly Church shows you Gabriel and Michael\nin human form, and him who healed Tobias—\nall to accommodate your way of seeing.\n\nWhat Timaeus argues about the soul\nbears no resemblance to what we see here,\nbecause it seems he believes what he speaks.\nHe says the soul returns to its own star,\nthinking it was severed from that place\nwhen nature gave it form within the body.\n\nPerhaps his teaching differs from the sound\nof his own words, and possibly carries meaning\nthat shouldn't be dismissed or mocked.\nIf he means that honor and blame return\nto these celestial wheels for their influence,\nperhaps his arrow hits upon some truth.\n\nThis misunderstood principle once warped\nnearly the entire world, leading it astray\nto invoke Jove and Mercury and Mars.\nThe other doubt that troubles you contains\nless poison, for its malice could never\nlead you away from me to other paths.\n\nThat our justice should appear unjust\nin mortal eyes—this is a matter of faith,\nnot heretical sin that damns the soul.\nBut so your understanding can penetrate\nthis truth completely, as you desire,\nI will give you full satisfaction.\n\nIf violence occurs when the one who suffers\ndoesn't cooperate with the one using force,\nthese souls still cannot be excused.\nWill is never extinguished unless it wills to be,\nbut works like fire within its nature—\neven if violence distorts it a thousand times.\n\nSo if will yields more or less, it aids\nthe force applied. These souls did exactly that,\nhaving the power to return to their holy place.\nIf their will had been perfect, like the will\nthat held Lawrence firm upon his burning grill,\nor made Mucius ruthless toward his own hand,\n\nit would have driven them back along the road\nfrom which they'd been dragged, the moment they were free.\nBut such unshakeable will is far too rare.\"\nWith these words, if you've gathered them correctly,\nthe argument that would have troubled you\nmany more times has been completely refuted.\n\nBut now another passage cuts across\nyour vision, one so dense you couldn't thread\nyour way through it before exhaustion claimed you.\nI have planted firmly in your mind\nthat blessed souls could never speak a lie,\nbeing so close to Truth in its pure form.\n\nYet you might have heard from Piccarda's lips\nthat Constance kept her love for the religious veil—\nso she seems to contradict my words.\nMany times, brother, it has come to pass\nthat someone, to escape from mortal danger,\nreluctantly did what should not be done.\n\nJust as Alcmaeon, urged on by his father,\nkilled his own mother, becoming pitiless\nin order not to lose his sense of duty.\nAt this point I want you to remember\nthat force mingles with will, and together\nthey cause offenses that cannot be excused.\n\nAbsolute will never consents to evil,\nbut consents only insofar as it fears\nthat refusing might bring even greater harm.\nSo when Piccarda used those words of hers,\nshe meant the absolute will, while I meant\nthe other kind—and both of us speak truth.\"\n\nSuch was the flowing of that holy river\nissuing from the fountain of all truth.\nThis set to rest every one of my longings.\n\"O beloved of the First Lover, O divine one,\"\nI said at once, \"whose words flood over me\nand warm me so they bring me more and more to life,\n\nmy own capacity for love runs not so deep\nas to suffice in giving grace for grace—\nlet Him who sees and can do all respond.\nI understand clearly that our intellect\nis never satisfied unless Truth illuminates it,\nbeyond which nothing true extends itself.\n\nIn Truth the mind rests like a wild beast in its lair\nonce it attains that goal—and it can reach it.\nIf not, then every desire would end in failure.\nThis is why doubt springs up like a green shoot\nat the foot of truth—this is nature's way\nof driving us from height to height toward the summit.\n\nThis invites me, this gives me confidence\nto ask you, Lady, with proper reverence,\nabout another truth that remains dark to me.\nI want to know: can mortals satisfy you\nfor broken vows with other good deeds,\nso they won't seem too light upon your scales?\"\n\nBeatrice looked at me with eyes so full\nof love's sparks, so utterly divine,\nthat my power failed me.

      "original": "If in the heat of love I flame upon thee Beyond the measure that on earth is seen, So that the valour of thine eyes I vanquish, Marvel thou not thereat; for this proceeds From perfect sight, which as it apprehends To the good apprehended moves its feet. Well I perceive how is already shining Into thine intellect the eternal light, That only seen enkindles always love; And if some other thing your love seduce, 'Tis nothing but a vestige of the same, Ill understood, which there is shining through. Thou fain wouldst know if with another service For broken vow can such return be made As to secure the soul from further claim.\" This Canto thus did Beatrice begin; And, as a man who breaks not off his speech, Continued thus her holy argument: \"The greatest gift that in his largess God Creating made, and unto his own goodness Nearest conformed, and that which he doth prize Most highly, is the freedom of the will, Wherewith the creatures of intelligence Both all and only were and are endowed. Now wilt thou see, if thence thou reasonest, The high worth of a vow, if it he made So that when thou consentest God consents: For, closing between God and man the compact, 305 A sacrifice is of this treasure made, Such as I say, and made by its own act. What can be rendered then as compensation? Think'st thou to make good use of what thou'st offered, With gains ill gotten thou wouldst do good deed. Now art thou certain of the greater point; But because Holy Church in this dispenses, Which seems against the truth which I have shown thee, Behoves thee still to sit awhile at table, Because the solid food which thou hast taken Requireth further aid for thy digestion. Open thy mind to that which I reveal, And fix it there within; for 'tis not knowledge, The having heard without retaining it. In the essence of this sacrifice two things Convene together; and the one is that Of which 'tis made, the other is the agreement. This last for evermore is cancelled not Unless complied with, and concerning this With such precision has above been spoken. Therefore it was enjoined upon the Hebrews To offer still, though sometimes what was offered Might be commuted, as thou ought'st to know. The other, which is known to thee as matter, May well indeed be such that one errs not If it for other matter be exchanged. But let none shift the burden on his shoulder At his arbitrament, without the turning Both of the white and of the yellow key; And every permutation deem as foolish, If in the substitute the thing relinquished, As the four is in six, be not contained. Therefore whatever thing has so great weight In value that it drags down every balance, Cannot be satisfied with other spending. Let mortals never take a vow in jest; Be faithful and not blind in doing that, As Jephthah was in his first offering, Whom more beseemed to say, 'I have done wrong, Than to do worse by keeping; and as foolish 306 \nThou the great leader of the Greeks wilt find, Whence wept Iphigenia her fair face, And made for her both wise and simple weep, Who heard such kind of worship spoken of.' Christians, be ye more serious in your movements; Be ye not like a feather at each wind, And think not every water washes you. Ye have the Old and the New Testament, And the Pastor of the Church who guideth you Let this suffice you unto your salvation. If evil appetite cry aught else to you, Be ye as men, and not as silly sheep, So that the Jew among you may not mock you. Be ye not as the lamb that doth abandon Its mother's milk, and frolicsome and simple Combats at its own pleasure with itself.\" Thus Beatrice to me even as I write it; Then all desireful turned herself again To that part where the world is most alive. Her silence and her change of countenance Silence imposed upon my eager mind, That had already in advance new questions; And as an arrow that upon the mark Strikes ere the bowstring quiet hath become, So did we speed into the second realm. My Lady there so joyful I beheld, As into the brightness of that heaven she entered, More luminous thereat the planet grew; And if the star itself was changed and smiled, What became I, who by my nature am Exceeding mutable in every guise! As, in a fish-pond which is pure and tranquil, The fishes draw to that which from without Comes in such fashion that their food they deem it; So I beheld more than a thousand splendours Drawing towards us, and in each was heard: \"Lo, this is she who shall increase our love.\" And as each one was coming unto us, Full of beatitude the shade was seen, By the effulgence clear that issued from it. 307 \nThink, Reader, if what here is just beginning No farther should proceed, how thou wouldst have An agonizing need of knowing more; And of thyself thou'lt see how I from these Was in desire of hearing their conditions, As they unto mine eyes were manifest. \"O thou well-born, unto whom Grace concedes To see the thrones of the eternal triumph, Or ever yet the warfare be abandoned With light that through the whole of heaven is spread Kindled are we, and hence if thou desirest To know of us, at thine own pleasure sate thee.\" Thus by some one among those holy spirits Was spoken, and by Beatrice: \"Speak, speak Securely, and believe them even as Gods.\" \"Well I perceive how thou dost nest thyself In thine own light, and drawest it from thine eyes, Because they coruscate when thou dost smile, But know not who thou art, nor why thou hast, Spirit august, thy station in the sphere That veils itself to men in alien rays.\" This said I in direction of the light Which first had spoken to me; whence it became By far more lucent than it was before. Even as the sun, that doth conceal himself By too much light, when heat has worn away The tempering influence of the vapours dense, By greater rapture thus concealed itself In its own radiance the figure saintly, And thus close, close enfolded answered me In fashion as the following Canto sings. 308",
      "modern": "If I blaze before you with a love's intensity\nbeyond what earthly eyes have ever witnessed,\noverwhelming the strength of your own sight,\ndo not wonder at this—\nit comes from perfect vision that perceives the good\nand moves toward what it has recognized.\n\nI see clearly how eternal light\nalready shines within your understanding,\nthat light which, once seen, kindles love forever.\nIf anything else seduces your heart,\nit is only a trace of this same light,\nmisunderstood, glimmering through the darkness.\n\nYou want to know whether some other service\ncan compensate for a broken vow enough\nto shield the soul from judgment's claim.\n\nWith these words Beatrice began this canto,\nand like someone who never breaks their thought,\nshe continued her sacred argument:\n\nThe greatest gift God made in his abundance,\nmost closely matching his own goodness,\nthe thing he treasures above all else,\nis freedom of the will—\ngiven to every creature blessed with reason,\nto them alone, to all of them.\n\nFrom this, if you think carefully,\nyou'll understand the supreme value of a vow\nmade so that when you consent, God consents.\nIn sealing this compact between human and divine,\nyou sacrifice this treasure by your own free act.\n\nWhat could possibly serve as compensation?\nDo you think you can make good use of what you've offered?\nYou would try to do good with stolen wealth.\n\nNow you understand the greater point.\nBut since Holy Church grants dispensations\nthat seem to contradict the truth I've shown you,\nyou must sit longer at this table—\nthe solid food you've consumed\nneeds more help for proper digestion.\n\nOpen your mind to what I reveal\nand hold it fast within.\nKnowledge is not merely hearing without retention.\n\nTwo elements come together in a vow's essence:\nthe subject matter of the promise\nand the agreement itself.\n\nThe agreement can never be canceled\nexcept through fulfillment. On this point\nI have spoken with absolute precision.\nThis is why the Hebrews were commanded\nto make offerings always,\nthough sometimes what was offered could be changed.\n\nThe other element—the subject matter—\nmay indeed be such that no wrong is done\nif it's exchanged for something else.\nBut let no one shift this burden\nby personal judgment alone,\nwithout both the silver and gold keys turning.\n\nConsider any substitution foolish\nunless what you give up is contained\nin the replacement, as four is contained in six.\n\nTherefore anything so weighty\nit tips every scale\ncannot be satisfied by other payment.\n\nLet mortals never make vows lightly.\nBe faithful, but not blind in keeping them—\ndon't be like Jephthah with his rash offering,\nwho should have said \"I was wrong\"\nrather than compound his error by keeping it.\nAnd consider the great Greek commander, equally foolish,\nwho made Iphigenia weep for her beautiful face\nand caused both wise and simple to mourn\nwhen they heard of such worship.\n\nChristians, move with greater seriousness.\nDon't be like feathers blown by every wind.\nDon't think every water can wash you clean.\nYou have the Old Testament and the New,\nand the Church's shepherd to guide you—\nlet this suffice for your salvation.\n\nIf wicked appetite cries out for more,\nbe human beings, not mindless sheep,\nso that no Jew among you mocks you.\nDon't be like the lamb that abandons\nits mother's milk to fight playfully\nand foolishly with its own shadow.\n\nThis is what Beatrice said to me, exactly as I write it.\nThen, full of longing, she turned again\ntoward that region where the world is most alive.\n\nHer silence and the change in her expression\nimposed silence on my eager mind,\nwhich already brimmed with new questions.\n\nLike an arrow that strikes its target\nbefore the bowstring has stopped vibrating,\nwe sped into the second sphere.\n\nThere I saw my Lady so joyful\nas she entered that heaven's brightness\nthat the planet itself grew more radiant.\nIf the star was transformed and smiled,\nwhat became of me, who by my very nature\nam supremely changeable in every way?\n\nAs fish in a clear, peaceful pond\nare drawn toward something from outside\nthat seems like food to them,\nso I saw more than a thousand splendors\nmoving toward us, and from each one heard:\n\"Here is she who will increase our love!\"\n\nAs each one approached us,\nthe shade appeared full of blessedness,\nrevealed by the clear radiance streaming from it.\n\nThink, reader, if what begins here\nshould go no further, how you would feel\nan agonizing need to know more.\nYou'll understand for yourself how I longed\nto hear about their conditions\nas soon as they appeared before my eyes.\n\n\"O soul born to grace, to whom heaven grants\nthe sight of eternal triumph's thrones\nbefore you've finished the battle of life,\nwe are kindled with the light\nthat spreads through all of heaven—\nif you wish to know about us, satisfy yourself.\"\n\nOne of those holy spirits spoke these words,\nand Beatrice said: \"Speak, speak\nwith confidence, and trust them as you would gods.\"\n\n\"I see clearly how you nest yourself\nin your own light and draw it through your eyes,\nfor they flash brilliance when you smile.\nBut I don't know who you are, or why,\naugust spirit, you hold your station\nin this sphere that veils itself from mortals\nin another's rays.\"\n\nI spoke these words toward the light\nthat had first addressed me,\nand it became far brighter than before.\n\nLike the sun that hides itself\nin too much light when heat has melted away\nthe tempering influence of dense vapors,\nso the holy figure concealed itself\nin its own radiance through greater rapture,\nand thus wrapped close within its brightness\nanswered me in the way\nthe following canto will sing.",

      "original": "\"After that Constantine the eagle turned Against the course of heaven, which it had followed Behind the ancient who Lavinia took, Two hundred years and more the bird of God In the extreme of Europe held itself, Near to the mountains whence it issued first; And under shadow of the sacred plumes It governed there the world from hand to hand, And, changing thus, upon mine own alighted. Caesar I was, and am Justinian, Who, by the will of primal Love I feel, Took from the laws the useless and redundant; And ere unto the work I was attent, One nature to exist in Christ, not more, Believed, and with such faith was I contented. But blessed Agapetus, he who was The supreme pastor, to the faith sincere Pointed me out the way by words of his. Him I believed, and what was his assertion I now see clearly, even as thou seest Each contradiction to be false and true. As soon as with the Church I moved my feet, God in his grace it pleased with this high task To inspire me, and I gave me wholly to it, And to my Belisarius I commended The arms, to which was heaven's right hand so joined It was a signal that I should repose. Now here to the first question terminates My answer; but the character thereof Constrains me to continue with a sequel, 309 In order that thou see with how great reason Men move against the standard sacrosanct, Both who appropriate and who oppose it. Behold how great a power has made it worthy Of reverence, beginning from the hour When Pallas died to give it sovereignty. Thou knowest it made in Alba its abode Three hundred years and upward, till at last The three to three fought for it yet again. Thou knowest what it achieved from Sabine wrong Down to Lucretia's sorrow, in seven kings O'ercoming round about the neighboring nations; Thou knowest what it achieved, borne by the Romans Illustrious against Brennus, against Pyrrhus, Against the other princes and confederates. Torquatus thence and Quinctius, who from locks Unkempt was named, Decii and Fabii, Received the fame I willingly embalm; It struck to earth the pride of the Arabians, Who, following Hannibal, had passed across The Alpine ridges, Po, from which thou glidest; Beneath it triumphed while they yet were young Pompey and Scipio, and to the hill Beneath which thou wast born it bitter seemed; Then, near unto the time when heaven had willed To bring the whole world to its mood serene, Did Caesar by the will of Rome assume it. What it achieved from Var unto the Rhine, Isere beheld and Saone, beheld the Seine, And every valley whence the Rhone is filled; What it achieved when it had left Ravenna, And leaped the Rubicon, was such a flight That neither tongue nor pen could follow it. Round towards Spain it wheeled its legions; then Towards Durazzo, and Pharsalia smote That to the calid Nile was felt the pain. Antandros and the Simois, whence it started, It saw again, and there where Hector lies, And ill for Ptolemy then roused itself. From thence it came like lightning upon Juba; 310 \nThen wheeled itself again into your West, Where the Pompeian clarion it heard. From what it wrought with the next standard-bearer Brutus and Cassius howl in Hell together, And Modena and Perugia dolent were; Still doth the mournful Cleopatra weep Because thereof, who, fleeing from before it, Took from the adder sudden and black death. With him it ran even to the Red Sea shore; With him it placed the world in so great peace, That unto Janus was his temple closed. But what the standard that has made me speak Achieved before, and after should achieve Throughout the mortal realm that lies beneath it, Becometh in appearance mean and dim, If in the hand of the third Caesar seen With eye unclouded and affection pure, Because the living Justice that inspires me Granted it, in the hand of him I speak of, The glory of doing vengeance for its wrath. Now here attend to what I answer thee; Later it ran with Titus to do vengeance Upon the vengeance of the ancient sin. And when the tooth of Lombardy had bitten The Holy Church, then underneath its wings Did Charlemagne victorious succor her. Now hast thou power to judge of such as those Whom I accused above, and of their crimes, Which are the cause of all your miseries. To the public standard one the yellow lilies Opposes, the other claims it for a party, So that 'tis hard to see which sins the most. Let, let the Ghibellines ply their handicraft Beneath some other standard; for this ever Ill follows he who it and justice parts. And let not this new Charles e'er strike it down, He and his Guelfs, but let him fear the talons That from a nobler lion stripped the fell. Already oftentimes the sons have wept The father's crime; and let him not believe 311 \nThat God will change His scutcheon for the lilies. This little planet doth adorn itself With the good spirits that have active been, That fame and honour might come after them; And whensoever the desires mount thither, Thus deviating, must perforce the rays Of the true love less vividly mount upward. But in commensuration of our wages With our desert is portion of our joy, Because we see them neither less nor greater. Herein doth living Justice sweeten so Affection in us, that for evermore It cannot warp to any iniquity. Voices diverse make up sweet melodies; So in this life of ours the seats diverse Render sweet harmony among these spheres; And in the compass of this present pearl Shineth the sheen of Romeo, of whom The grand and beauteous work was ill rewarded. But the Provencals who against him wrought, They have not laughed, and therefore ill goes he Who makes his hurt of the good deeds of others. Four daughters, and each one of them a queen, Had Raymond Berenger, and this for him Did Romeo, a poor man and a pilgrim; And then malicious words incited him To summon to a reckoning this just man, Who rendered to him seven and five for ten. Then he departed poor and stricken in years, And if the world could know the heart he had, In begging bit by bit his livelihood, Though much it laud him, it would laud him more.\" 312",

hand,\nchanging rulers until it came to rest on mine.\n\nI was Caesar, and I am Justinian,\nwho by the will of that first Love I worship\nstripped the laws of all that was useless and excessive.\nBefore I turned my attention to this work,\nI believed that Christ had but one nature, not two,\nand I was satisfied with such faith.\n\nBut blessed Agapetus, who was\nthe supreme shepherd, pointed me toward\nthe true faith with his words.\nI believed him, and what he declared\nI now see as clearly as you see\nthat contradictions cannot both be false and true.\n\nAs soon as I aligned myself with the Church,\nGod in his grace was pleased to inspire me\nwith this high calling, and I gave myself wholly to it.\nTo my general Belisarius I entrusted\nthe armies, and heaven's right hand joined with his\nso perfectly it was a sign that I should find peace.\n\nHere ends my answer to your first question,\nbut its nature compels me to continue\nwith more, so that you might understand\nwith what poor reason men move against\nthe sacred standard—both those who claim it falsely\nand those who oppose it entirely.\n\nSee how much virtue has made it worthy\nof reverence, beginning from the hour\nwhen Pallas died to give it sovereignty.\nYou know it made its home in Alba\nfor three hundred years and more, until at last\nthe three brothers fought the three for it again.\n\nYou know what it accomplished from the Sabine wrong\ndown to Lucretia's grief, under seven kings,\nconquering all the neighboring peoples.\nYou know what it achieved when carried\nby

it accomplished from the Var to the Rhine\nthe Isère witnessed, and the Saône and Seine,\nand every valley that feeds the Rhône.\nWhat it achieved after leaving Ravenna\nand leaping the Rubicon was such swift flight\nthat neither tongue nor pen could follow.\n\nIt wheeled its legions toward Spain,\nthen toward Durrës, and struck at Pharsalus\nso hard the burning Nile felt the blow.\nIt saw again Antandros and the Simois\nwhere it began, and where Hector lies,\nthen stirred itself—ill fortune for Ptolemy.\n\nFrom there it fell like lightning upon Juba,\nthen wheeled back toward your West\nwhere it heard Pompey's trumpet sound.\nWhat it accomplished with the next standard-bearer\nmakes Brutus and Cassius howl together in Hell,\nand left Modena and Perugia grieving.\n\nThe wretched Cleopatra still weeps\nbecause of it—she who, fleeing before it,\ntook sudden black death from the asp.\nWith Augustus it ran even to the Red Sea shore;\nwith him it brought the world such peace\nthat

it in the hand of the third Caesar\nwith clear eyes and pure love—\n\nbecause the living Justice that inspires me\ngranted it, in his hand of whom I speak,\nthe glory of wreaking vengeance for divine wrath.\nNow pay attention to my answer:\nlater it ran with Titus to take vengeance\nupon the vengeance for that ancient sin.\n\nAnd when the Lombard tooth bit\nthe Holy Church, then under those wings\nCharlemagne came victorious to her aid.\nNow you can judge those whom I accused above\nand their crimes, which are the cause\nof all your sufferings.\n\nAgainst the public standard one faction opposes\nthe yellow lilies, another claims it for their party,\nso it's hard to see which sins more.\nLet the Ghibellines practice their craft\nunder some other banner—for disaster always follows\nthose who separate this standard from justice.\n\nAnd let not this new Charles strike it down,\nhe and his Guelphs, but let him fear the talons\nthat tore the hide from a nobler lion.\nMany times already have sons wept\nfor their father's crimes—let him not think\nthat God will trade his coat of arms for lilies.\n\nThis small planet adorns itself\nwith good spirits who were active in life\nso that fame and honor might follow them.\nWhen earthly desires rise to such heights,\ndeviating from their true course,\nthe rays of authentic love must mount less brightly upward.\n\nBut that our wages match exactly\nour merit is part of our joy,\nbecause we see them neither less nor greater.\nHere living Justice so sweetens\nour affection that it can never again\nbe twisted toward any wickedness.\n\nDifferent voices create sweet harmonies;\nso in our life the different ranks\nrender sweet harmony among these spheres.\nWithin the compass of this very pearl\nshines the light of

      "original": "In this wise, to his melody returning, This substance, upon which a double light Doubles itself, was seen by me to sing, And to their dance this and the others moved, And in the manner of swift-hurrying sparks Veiled themselves from me with a sudden distance. Doubting was I, and saying, \"Tell her, tell her,\" Within me, \"tell her,\" saying, \"tell my Lady,\" Who slakes my thirst with her sweet effluences; And yet that reverence which doth lord it over The whole of me only by B and ICE, Bowed me again like unto one who drowses. Short while did Beatrice endure me thus; And she began, lighting me with a smile Such as would make one happy in the fire: \"According to infallible advisement, After what manner a just vengeance justly Could be avenged has put thee upon thinking, But I will speedily thy mind unloose; And do thou listen, for these words of mine Of a great doctrine will a present make thee. By not enduring on the power that wills Curb for his good, that man who ne'er was born, Damning himself damned all his progeny; Whereby the human species down below 313 Lay sick for many centuries in great error, Till to descend it pleased the Word of God To where the nature, which from its own Maker Estranged itself, he joined to him in person By the sole act of his eternal love. Now unto what is said direct thy sight; This nature when united to its Maker, Such as created, was sincere and good; But by itself alone was banished forth From Paradise, because it turned aside Out of the way of truth and of its life. Therefore the penalty the cross held out, If measured by the nature thus assumed, None ever yet with so great justice stung, And none was ever of so great injustice, Considering who the Person was that suffered, Within whom such a nature was contracted. From one act therefore issued things diverse; To God and to the Jews one death was pleasing; Earth trembled at it and the Heaven was opened. It should no longer now seem difficult To thee, when it is said that a just vengeance By a just court was afterward avenged. But now do I behold thy mind entangled From thought to thought within a knot, from which With great desire it waits to free itself. Thou sayest, 'Well discern I what I hear; But it is hidden from me why God willed For our redemption only this one mode.' Buried remaineth, brother, this decree Unto the eyes of every one whose nature Is in the flame of love not yet adult. Verily, inasmuch as at this mark One gazes long and little is discerned, Wherefore this mode was worthiest will I say. Goodness Divine, which from itself doth spurn All envy, burning in itself so sparkles That the eternal beauties it unfolds. Whate'er from this immediately distils Has afterwards no end, for ne'er removed 314 \nIs its impression when it sets its seal. Whate'er from this immediately rains down Is wholly free, because it is not subject Unto the influences of novel things. The more conformed thereto, the more it pleases; For the blest ardour that irradiates all things In that most like itself is most vivacious. With all of these things has advantaged been The human creature; and if one be wanting, From his nobility he needs must fall. 'Tis sin alone which doth disfranchise him, And render him unlike the Good Supreme, So that he little with its light is blanched, And to his dignity no more returns, Unless he fill up where transgression empties With righteous pains for criminal delights. Your nature when it sinned so utterly In its own seed, out of these dignities Even as out of Paradise was driven, Nor could itself recover, if thou notest With nicest subtilty, by any way, Except by passing one of these two fords: Either that God through clemency alone Had pardon granted, or that man himself Had satisfaction for his folly made. Fix now thine eye deep into the abyss Of the eternal counsel, to my speech As far as may be fastened steadfastly! Man in his limitations had not power To satisfy, not having power to sink In his humility obeying then, Far as he disobeying thought to rise; And for this reason man has been from power Of satisfying by himself excluded. Therefore it God behoved in his own ways Man to restore unto his perfect life, I say in one, or else in both of them. But since the action of the doer is So much more grateful, as it more presents The goodness of the heart from which it issues, 315 \nGoodness Divine, that doth imprint the world, Has been contented to proceed by each And all its ways to lift you up again; Nor 'twixt the first day and the final night Such high and such magnificent proceeding By one or by the other was or shall be; For God more bounteous was himself to give To make man able to uplift himself, Than if he only of himself had pardoned; And all the other modes were insufficient For justice, were it not the Son of God Himself had humbled to become incarnate. Now, to fill fully each desire of thine, Return I to elucidate one place, In order that thou there mayst see as I do. Thou sayst: 'I see the air, I see the fire, The water, and the earth, and all their mixtures Come to corruption, and short while endure; And these things notwithstanding were created;' Therefore if that which I have said were true, They should have been secure against corruption. The Angels, brother, and the land sincere In which thou art, created may be called Just as they are in their entire existence; But all the elements which thou hast named, And all those things which out of them are made, By a created virtue are informed. Created was the matter which they have; Created was the informing influence Within these stars that round about them go. The soul of every brute and of the plants By its potential temperament attracts The ray and motion of the holy lights; But your own life immediately inspires Supreme Beneficence, and enamours it So with herself, it evermore desires her. And thou from this mayst argue furthermore Your resurrection, if thou think again How human flesh was fashioned at that time When the first parents both of them were made.\" 316",
      "modern": "Returning to their melody, \nthis radiant substance crowned with double light\nbegan to sing, dancing with the others,\nand like swift sparks hurrying through darkness\nthey veiled themselves from me with sudden distance.\n\nI hesitated, saying within myself,\n\"Ask her, ask her—tell my Lady\nwho quenches my thirst with her sweet wisdom.\"\nBut that reverence which masters all of me\nthrough her very being\nbowed my head like one drowsing.\n\nBeatrice endured my silence only briefly,\nthen began, illuminating me with a smile\nthat could make one blessed even in fire:\n\n\"According to infallible wisdom,\nthe question of how just vengeance\ncould itself be justly punished troubles your mind.\nBut I will quickly untangle your thoughts—\nlisten carefully, for my words\nwill give you a great teaching.\n\nBy refusing to accept the limits\nplaced on his will for his own good,\nthat man who was never born\ndamned himself and all his children.\nSo the human race below\nlay sick for many centuries in great error,\nuntil it pleased the Word of God to descend\nto where our nature, estranged from its Maker,\ncould be joined to him in one person\nby the sole act of his eternal love.\n\nNow direct your attention to what I say:\nthis nature, when united with its Creator,\nwas pure and good as when first made.\nBut by itself alone it was banished\nfrom Paradise, because it turned away\nfrom the path of truth and life.\n\nTherefore the penalty the cross offered,\nmeasured against the nature Christ assumed,\nnever struck with such perfect justice—\nyet none was ever so unjust,\nconsidering the Person who suffered,\nin whom that nature was contained.\n\nFrom one act came opposite results:\none death pleased both God and the Jews,\nmade earth tremble and heaven open.\n\nIt should no longer seem difficult\nwhen you hear that a just vengeance\nwas later justly avenged by a just court.\n\nBut now I see your mind entangled\nin thought after thought, knotted tight,\ndesperately wanting to free itself.\nYou say, 'I understand what I hear clearly,\nbut why did God choose\nonly this method for our redemption?'\n\nThis decree remains buried, brother,\nfrom the eyes of everyone whose nature\nhas not yet matured in love's flame.\nSince one can gaze long at this mystery\nand perceive little, I will explain\nwhy this way was most worthy.\n\nDivine Goodness, which spurns all envy,\nburns so brightly within itself\nthat it unfolds eternal beauties.\nWhatever flows directly from this source\nhas no end, for its seal\ncan never be removed once set.\nWhatever rains down directly from this\nis completely free, not subject\nto the influence of created things.\nThe more something conforms to this,\nthe more it pleases, for the blessed fire\nthat illuminates all things\nis most alive in what most resembles it.\n\nThe human creature was advantaged\nwith all these gifts, and lacking any one,\nmust fall from nobility.\nSin alone strips away this franchise,\nmakes us unlike the Supreme Good,\nso we are barely touched by its light\nand cannot return to our dignity\nunless we fill transgression's emptiness\nwith just suffering for criminal pleasures.\n\nYour nature, when it sinned completely\nin its very seed, was driven\nfrom these dignities as from Paradise,\nnor could it recover by any path—\nif you examine this with subtle care—\nexcept by crossing one of two fords:\neither God through mercy alone\ngrants forgiveness, or humanity itself\nmakes satisfaction for its folly.\n\nFix your gaze now deep into the abyss\nof eternal counsel, listening\nto my words with all attention.\n\nHumanity in its limitations had no power\nto make satisfaction, unable to descend\nin humble obedience as far\nas it had thought to rise in disobedience.\nFor this reason humanity was excluded\nfrom the power of self-satisfaction.\n\nTherefore it was necessary for God\nto restore humanity to perfect life\nby his own ways—one or both of them.\nBut since the doer's action is more pleasing\nthe more it displays the goodness\nof the heart from which it springs,\nDivine Goodness that imprints the world\nwas content to proceed by all its ways\nto lift you up again.\n\nNever between first day and final night\nwas there or will there be such high\nand magnificent proceeding by either path.\nGod was more generous giving himself\nto make humanity able to rise again\nthan if he had simply pardoned.\nAll other methods would have been insufficient\nfor justice, had not the Son of God\nhumbled himself to become incarnate.\n\nNow, to satisfy completely every desire of yours,\nI return to clarify one point\nso you may see as I do.\nYou say: 'I see air, fire,\nwater, earth, and all their combinations\ncome to corruption and endure briefly,\nyet these things too were created.'\nIf what I have said were true,\nthey should be secure from corruption.\n\nThe Angels, brother, and this pure realm\nwhere you now stand can be called created\nexactly as they exist in their complete being.\nBut all the elements you have named\nand everything made from them\nare informed by created power.\n\nCreated was the matter they possess,\ncreated was the shaping influence\nwithin these stars that circle them.\nThe soul of every animal and plant\ndraws from the ray and motion\nof the holy lights through its natural temperament.\n\nBut your life is breathed directly\nby Supreme Beneficence, who so enamors it\nwith herself that it desires her forever.\nFrom this you can further conclude\nyour resurrection, if you remember again\nhow human flesh was first fashioned\nwhen both our first parents were made.\"",

I was not ware of our ascending to it; But of our being in it gave full faith My Lady whom I saw more beauteous grow. And as within a flame a spark is seen, And as within a voice a voice discerned, When one is steadfast, and one comes and goes, Within that light beheld I other lamps Move in a circle, speeding more and less, Methinks in measure of their inward vision. From a cold cloud descended never winds, Or visible or not, so rapidly They would not laggard and impeded seem To any one who had those lights divine Seen come towards us, leaving the gyration Begun at first in the high Seraphim.

We turn around with the celestial Princes, One gyre and one gyration and one thirst, To whom thou in the world of old didst say, 'Ye who, intelligent, the third heaven are moving;' And are so full of love, to pleasure thee A little quiet will not be less sweet.\" After these eyes of mine themselves had offered Unto my Lady reverently, and she Content and certain of herself had made them, Back to the light they turned, which so great promise Made of itself, and \"Say, who art thou?\" was My voice, imprinted with a great affection. O how and how much I beheld it grow With the new joy that superadded was Unto its joys, as soon as I had spoken! Thus changed, it said to me: \"The world possessed me Short time below; and, if it had been more, Much evil will be which would not have been. My gladness keepeth me concealed from thee, Which rayeth round about me, and doth hide me Like as a creature swathed in its own silk. Much didst thou love me, and thou hadst good reason; For had I been below, I should have shown thee Somewhat beyond the foliage of my love. That left-hand margin, which doth bathe itself In Rhone, when it is mingled with the Sorgue, Me for its lord awaited in due time, And that horn of Ausonia, which is towned With Bari, with Gaeta and Catona, Whence Tronto and Verde in the sea disgorge. Already flashed upon my brow the crown Of that dominion which the Danube waters After the German borders it abandons; And beautiful Trinacria, that is murky 'Twixt Pachino and Peloro, (on the gulf Which greatest scath from Eurus doth receive,) 318 \nNot through Typhoeus, but through nascent sulphur, Would have awaited her own monarchs still, Through me from Charles descended and from Rudolph, If evil lordship, that exasperates ever The subject populations, had not moved Palermo to the outcry of 'Death! death!' And if my brother could but this foresee, The greedy poverty of Catalonia Straight would he flee, that it might not molest him; For verily 'tis needful to provide, Through him or other, so that on his bark Already freighted no more freight be placed. His nature, which from liberal covetous Descended, such a soldiery would need As should not care for hoarding in a chest.\" \"Because I do believe the lofty joy Thy speech infuses into me, my Lord, Where every good thing doth begin and end Thou seest as I see it, the more grateful Is it to me; and this too hold I dear, That gazing upon God thou dost discern it. Glad hast thou made me; so make clear to me, Since speaking thou hast stirred me up to doubt, How from sweet seed can bitter issue forth.\" This I to him; and he to me: \"If I Can show to thee a truth, to what thou askest Thy face thou'lt hold as thou dost hold thy back. The Good which all the realm thou art ascending Turns and contents, maketh its providence To be a power within these bodies vast; And not alone the natures are foreseen Within the mind that in itself is perfect, But they together with their preservation. For whatsoever thing this bow shoots forth Falls foreordained unto an end foreseen, Even as a shaft directed to its mark. If that were not, the heaven which thou dost walk Would in such manner its effects produce, That they no longer would be arts, but ruins. This cannot be, if the Intelligences 319 \nThat keep these stars in motion are not maimed, And maimed the First that has not made them perfect. Wilt thou this truth have clearer made to thee?\" And I: \"Not so; for 'tis impossible That nature tire, I see, in what is needful.\" Whence he again: \"Now say, would it be worse For men on earth were they not citizens?\" \"Yes,\" I replied; \"and here I ask no reason.\" \"And can they be so, if below they live not Diversely unto offices diverse? No, if your master writeth well for you.\" So came he with deductions to this point; Then he concluded: \"Therefore it behoves The roots of your effects to be diverse. Hence one is Solon born, another Xerxes, Another Melchisedec, and another he Who, flying through the air, his son did lose. Revolving Nature, which a signet is To mortal wax, doth practise well her art, But not one inn distinguish from another; Thence happens it that Esau differeth In seed from Jacob; and Quirinus comes From sire so vile that he is given to Mars. A generated nature its own way Would always make like its progenitors, If Providence divine were not triumphant. Now that which was behind thee is before thee; But that thou know that I with thee am pleased, With a corollary will I mantle thee. Evermore nature, if it fortune find Discordant to it, like each other seed Out of its region, maketh evil thrift; And if the world below would fix its mind On the foundation which is laid by nature, Pursuing that, 'twould have the people good. But you unto religion wrench aside Him who was born to gird him with the sword, And make a king of him who is for sermons; Therefore your footsteps wander from the road.\" 320",
      "modern": "The ancients in their error believed\nthat beautiful Venus poured down\nher maddening love from the third sphere,\nturning in its celestial dance.\n\nSo the old nations honored her\nwith sacrifices and prayers,\nand worshipped Dione as her mother,\nCupid as her son—\nthe one who sat in Dido's lap.\n\nFrom her they named the star\nthat courts the sun,\nsometimes following, sometimes leading.\n\nI didn't notice our ascent,\nbut knew we'd arrived\nwhen I saw my Lady grow more beautiful.\n\nAs a spark glows within flame,\nas one voice sounds within another\nwhen one holds steady and one wavers,\nso within that light I saw other lamps\nmoving in circles at different speeds,\neach according to the depth of their vision.\n\nNever did winds descend from winter clouds—\nvisible or invisible—so swiftly\nthat they wouldn't seem sluggish and delayed\nto anyone who had seen those divine lights\nrushing toward us, breaking from the dance\nfirst begun among the high Seraphim.\n\nFrom those leading the way\ncame \"Hosanna!\" so beautiful\nI've longed to hear it ever since.\n\nThen one approached us closer\nand spoke alone: \"We are all ready\nto serve your pleasure, that you might joy in us.\nWe turn with the celestial Princes\nin one circle, one motion, one thirst—\nthose you once called in the world below:\n'You who move the third heaven with intelligence.'\nWe are so full of love that to please you\na moment's rest will be no less sweet.\"\n\nAfter my eyes turned reverently\nto my Lady, and she made them\ncontent and certain of themselves,\nthey returned to the light that promised so much,\nand I said, with deep affection:\n\"Tell me, who are you?\"\n\nHow I watched it expand\nwith new joy added to its joys\nthe moment I had spoken!\n\nChanged this way, it said to me:\n\"The world possessed me briefly below;\nhad it been longer, much evil\nthat will be would never have been.\n\nMy happiness keeps me hidden from you,\nradiating around me and concealing me\nlike a creature wrapped in its own silk.\n\nYou loved me greatly, and with good reason—\nhad I remained below, I would have shown you\nmore than just the leaves of my love.\n\nThat left bank that bathes itself\nin the Rhone where it mingles with the Sorgue\nawaited me as its rightful lord,\nand that horn of Italy crowned\nwith Bari, Gaeta, and Catona,\nwhere the Tronto and Verde pour into the sea.\n\nAlready on my brow flashed the crown\nof that land watered by the Danube\nafter it leaves the German borders.\n\nAnd beautiful Sicily, darkened\nbetween Pachino and Peloro\non the gulf that suffers most from the east wind,\nwould still await its rightful kings—\nnot through mythic Typhoeus but through sulfur born—\ndescended through me from Charles and Rudolf,\nif evil rule that always embitters\nsubject peoples had not moved\nPalermo to cry 'Death! Death!'\n\nIf my brother could foresee this,\nhe would flee Catalonia's greedy poverty\nbefore it troubles him further.\nSomeone must provide—through him or another—\nthat no more cargo be loaded\non his already heavy bark.\n\nHis nature, descended from generous to grasping,\nwould need soldiers who don't care\nabout hoarding treasure in chests.\"\n\n\"Because I believe the lofty joy\nyour words pour into me, my Lord,\nis seen by you as I see it\nthere where every good begins and ends,\nit becomes more precious to me.\nAnd I treasure this too—\nthat you discern it by gazing upon God.\n\nYou have made me glad;\nnow clarify for me,\nsince your speech has stirred me to doubt:\nHow can bitter fruit come from sweet seed?\"\n\nThis I asked him, and he replied:\n\"If I can show you one truth,\nyou'll face what you're asking about\nas you now turn your back to it.\n\nThe Good that turns and satisfies\nall the realm you're ascending\nmakes its providence a power\nwithin these vast celestial bodies.\n\nNot only are individual natures foreseen\nin the mind that is perfect in itself,\nbut they together with their preservation.\n\nWhatever this bow shoots forth\nfalls destined to a foreseen end,\nlike an arrow aimed at its target.\n\nIf this were not so, the heaven you walk through\nwould create its effects in such a way\nthat they would be chaos, not art.\n\nThis cannot be, unless the Intelligences\nthat move these stars are flawed,\nand flawed too the First who made them perfect.\n\nDo you want this truth made clearer?\"\n\nAnd I: \"No, for I see it's impossible\nthat nature would fail in what is necessary.\"\n\nThen he continued: \"Tell me, would it be worse\nfor people on earth if they were not citizens?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I replied, \"and I need no proof.\"\n\n\"And can they be citizens if below\nthey don't live differently in different roles?\nNo—if your master writes truly for you.\"\n\nWith such reasoning he reached this point,\nthen concluded: \"Therefore the roots\nof your effects must be diverse.\n\nSo one is born Solon, another Xerxes,\nanother Melchizedek, and another\nthe one who flew through air and lost his son.\n\nRevolving Nature, which is like a seal\non mortal wax, practices her art well\nbut doesn't distinguish one dwelling from another.\n\nThis is why Esau differs in nature\nfrom Jacob, and Quirinus comes\nfrom a father so base he's credited to Mars.\n\nGenerated nature would always make\nits offspring like their parents\nif divine Providence didn't override it.\n\nNow what was behind you is before you.\nBut so you know I take pleasure in you,\nlet me wrap you in this corollary:\n\nAlways, when nature finds fortune\ndiscordant with it, like any seed\nout of its proper region, it thrives poorly.\n\nIf the world below would fix its attention\non the foundation nature lays\nand follow that, it would have good people.\n\nBut you twist toward religion\nthe one born to wear a sword,\nand make a king of one meant for sermons.\nTherefore your steps wander from the path.\"",

      "original": "Beautiful Clemence, after that thy Charles Had me enlightened, he narrated to me The treacheries his seed should undergo; But said: \"Be still and let the years roll round;\" So I can only say, that lamentation Legitimate shall follow on your wrongs. And of that holy light the life already Had to the Sun which fills it turned again, As to that good which for each thing sufficeth. Ah, souls deceived, and creatures impious, Who from such good do turn away your hearts, Directing upon vanity your foreheads! And now, behold, another of those splendours Approached me, and its will to pleasure me It signified by brightening outwardly. The eyes of Beatrice, that fastened were Upon me, as before, of dear assent To my desire assurance gave to me. \"Ah, bring swift compensation to my wish, Thou blessed spirit,\" I said, \"and give me proof That what I think in thee I can reflect!\" Whereat the light, that still was new to me, Out of its depths, whence it before was singing, As one delighted to do good, continued: \"Within that region of the land depraved Of Italy, that lies between Rialto And fountain-heads of Brenta and of Piava, Rises a hill, and mounts not very high, Wherefrom descended formerly a torch 321 That made upon that region great assault. Out of one root were born both I and it; Cunizza was I called, and here I shine Because the splendour of this star o'ercame me. But gladly to myself the cause I pardon Of my allotment, and it does not grieve me; Which would perhaps seem strong unto your vulgar. Of this so luculent and precious jewel, Which of our heaven is nearest unto me, Great fame remained; and ere it die away This hundredth year shall yet quintupled be. See if man ought to make him excellent, So that another life the first may leave! And thus thinks not the present multitude Shut in by Adige and Tagliamento, Nor yet for being scourged is penitent. But soon 'twill be that Padua in the marsh Will change the water that Vicenza bathes, Because the folk are stubborn against duty; And where the Sile and Cagnano join One lordeth it, and goes with lofty head, For catching whom e'en now the net is making. Feltro moreover of her impious pastor Shall weep the crime, which shall so monstrous be That for the like none ever entered Malta. Ample exceedingly would be the vat That of the Ferrarese could hold the blood, And weary who should weigh it ounce by ounce, Of which this courteous priest shall make a gift To show himself a partisan; and such gifts Will to the living of the land conform. Above us there are mirrors, Thrones you call them, From which shines out on us God Judicant, So that this utterance seems good to us.\" Here it was silent, and it had the semblance Of being turned elsewhither, by the wheel On which it entered as it was before. The other joy, already known to me, Became a thing transplendent in my sight, As a fine ruby smitten by the sun. 322 \nThrough joy effulgence is acquired above, As here a smile; but down below, the shade Outwardly darkens, as the mind is sad. \"God seeth all things, and in Him, blest spirit, Thy sight is,\" said I, \"so that never will Of his can possibly from thee be hidden; Thy voice, then, that for ever makes the heavens Glad, with the singing of those holy fires Which of their six wings make themselves a cowl, Wherefore does it not satisfy my longings? Indeed, I would not wait thy questioning If I in thee were as thou art in me.\" \"The greatest of the valleys where the water Expands itself,\" forthwith its words began, \"That sea excepted which the earth engarlands, Between discordant shores against the sun Extends so far, that it meridian makes Where it was wont before to make the horizon. I was a dweller on that valley's shore 'Twixt Ebro and Magra that with journey short Doth from the Tuscan part the Genoese. With the same sunset and same sunrise nearly Sit Buggia and the city whence I was, That with its blood once made the harbour hot. Folco that people called me unto whom My name was known; and now with me this heaven Imprints itself, as I did once with it; For more the daughter of Belus never burned, Offending both Sichaeus and Creusa, Than I, so long as it became my locks, Nor yet that Rodophean, who deluded was by Demophoon, nor yet Alcides, When Iole he in his heart had locked. Yet here is no repenting, but we smile, Not at the fault, which comes not back to mind, But at the power which ordered and foresaw. Here we behold the art that doth adorn With such affection, and the good discover Whereby the world above turns that below. But that thou wholly satisfied mayst bear 323 \nThy wishes hence which in this sphere are born, Still farther to proceed behoveth me. Thou fain wouldst know who is within this light That here beside me thus is scintillating, Even as a sunbeam in the limpid water. Then know thou, that within there is at rest Rahab, and being to our order joined, With her in its supremest grade 'tis sealed. Into this heaven, where ends the shadowy cone Cast by your world, before all other souls First of Christ's triumph was she taken up. Full meet it was to leave her in some heaven, Even as a palm of the high victory Which he acquired with one palm and the other, Because she favoured the first glorious deed Of Joshua upon the Holy Land, That little stirs the memory of the Pope. Thy city, which an offshoot is of him Who first upon his Maker turned his back, And whose ambition is so sorely wept, Brings forth and scatters the accursed flower Which both the sheep and lambs hath led astray Since it has turned the shepherd to a wolf. For this the Evangel and the mighty Doctors Are derelict, and only the Decretals So studied that it shows upon their margins. On this are Pope and Cardinals intent; Their meditations reach not Nazareth, There where his pinions Gabriel unfolded; But Vatican and the other parts elect Of Rome, which have a cemetery been Unto the soldiery that followed Peter Shall soon be free from this adultery.\" 324",

      "original": "Looking into his Son with all the Love Which each of them eternally breathes forth, The Primal and unutterable Power Whate'er before the mind or eye revolves With so much order made, there can be none Who this beholds without enjoying Him. Lift up then, Reader, to the lofty wheels With me thy vision straight unto that part Where the one motion on the other strikes, And there begin to contemplate with joy That Master's art, who in himself so loves it That never doth his eye depart therefrom. Behold how from that point goes branching off The oblique circle, which conveys the planets, To satisfy the world that calls upon them; And if their pathway were not thus inflected, Much virtue in the heavens would be in vain, And almost every power below here dead. If from the straight line distant more or less Were the departure, much would wanting be Above and underneath of mundane order. Remain now, Reader, still upon thy bench, In thought pursuing that which is foretasted, If thou wouldst jocund be instead of weary. I've set before thee; henceforth feed thyself, For to itself diverteth all my care That theme whereof I have been made the scribe. The greatest of the ministers of nature, Who with the power of heaven the world imprints 325 And measures with his light the time for us, With that part which above is called to mind Conjoined, along the spirals was revolving, Where each time earlier he presents himself; And I was with him; but of the ascending I was not conscious, saving as a man Of a first thought is conscious ere it come; And Beatrice, she who is seen to pass From good to better, and so suddenly That not by time her action is expressed, How lucent in herself must she have been! And what was in the sun, wherein I entered, Apparent not by colour but by light, I, though I call on genius, art, and practice, Cannot so tell that it could be imagined; Believe one can, and let him long to see it. And if our fantasies too lowly are For altitude so great, it is no marvel, Since o'er the sun was never eye could go. Such in this place was the fourth family Of the high Father, who forever sates it, Showing how he breathes forth and how begets. And Beatrice began: \"Give thanks, give thanks Unto the Sun of Angels, who to this Sensible one has raised thee by his grace!\" Never was heart of mortal so disposed To worship, nor to give itself to God With all its gratitude was it so ready, As at those words did I myself become; And all my love was so absorbed in Him, That in oblivion Beatrice was eclipsed. Nor this displeased her; but she smiled at it So that the splendour of her laughing eyes My single mind on many things divided. Lights many saw I, vivid and triumphant, Make us a centre and themselves a circle, More sweet in voice than luminous in aspect. Thus girt about the daughter of Latona We sometimes see, when pregnant is the air, So that it holds the thread which makes her zone. 326 \nWithin the court of Heaven, whence I return, Are many jewels found, so fair and precious They cannot be transported from the realm; And of them was the singing of those lights. Who takes not wings that he may fly up thither, The tidings thence may from the dumb await! As soon as singing thus those burning suns Had round about us whirled themselves three times, Like unto stars neighbouring the steadfast poles, Ladies they seemed, not from the dance released, But who stop short, in silence listening Till they have gathered the new melody. And within one I heard beginning: \"When The radiance of grace, by which is kindled True love, and which thereafter grows by loving, Within thee multiplied is so resplendent That it conducts thee upward by that stair, Where without reascending none descends, Who should deny the wine out of his vial Unto thy thirst, in liberty were not Except as water which descends not seaward. Fain wouldst thou know with what plants is enflowered This garland that encircles with delight The Lady fair who makes thee strong for heaven. Of the lambs was I of the holy flock Which Dominic conducteth by a road Where well one fattens if he strayeth not. He who is nearest to me on the right My brother and master was; and he Albertus Is of Cologne, I Thomas of Aquinum. If thou of all the others wouldst be certain, Follow behind my speaking with thy sight Upward along the blessed garland turning. That next effulgence issues from the smile Of Gratian, who assisted both the courts In such wise that it pleased in Paradise. The other which near by adorns our choir That Peter was who, e'en as the poor widow, Offered his treasure unto Holy Church. The fifth light, that among us is the fairest, 327 \nBreathes forth from such a love, that all the world Below is greedy to learn tidings of it. Within it is the lofty mind, where knowledge So deep was put, that, if the true be true, To see so much there never rose a second. Thou seest next the lustre of that taper, Which in the flesh below looked most within The angelic nature and its ministry. Within that other little light is smiling The advocate of the Christian centuries, Out of whose rhetoric Augustine was furnished. Now if thou trainest thy mind's eye along From light to light pursuant of my praise, With thirst already of the eighth thou waitest. By seeing every good therein exults The sainted soul, which the fallacious world Makes manifest to him who listeneth well; The body whence 'twas hunted forth is lying Down in Cieldauro, and from martyrdom And banishment it came unto this peace. See farther onward flame the burning breath Of Isidore, of Beda, and of Richard Who was in contemplation more than man. This, whence to me returneth thy regard, The light is of a spirit unto whom In his grave meditations death seemed slow. It is the light eternal of Sigier, Who, reading lectures in the Street of Straw, Did syllogize invidious verities.\" Then, as a horologe that calleth us What time the Bride of God is rising up With matins to her Spouse that he may love her, Wherein one part the other draws and urges, Ting! ting! resounding with so sweet a note, That swells with love the spirit well disposed, Thus I beheld the glorious wheel move round, And render voice to voice, in modulation And sweetness that can not be comprehended, Excepting there where joy is made eternal. 328",

One after laws and one to aphorisms Was going, and one following the priesthood, And one to reign by force or sophistry, And one in theft, and one in state affairs, One in the pleasures of the flesh involved Wearied himself, one gave himself to ease; When I, from all these things emancipate, With Beatrice above there in the Heavens With such exceeding glory was received! When each one had returned unto that point Within the circle where it was before, It stood as in a candlestick a candle; And from within the effulgence which at first Had spoken unto me, I heard begin Smiling while it more luminous became: \"Even as I am kindled in its ray, So, looking into the Eternal Light, The occasion of thy thoughts I apprehend. Thou doubtest, and wouldst have me to resift In language so extended and so open My speech, that to thy sense it may be plain, Where just before I said, 'where well one fattens,' And where I said, 'there never rose a second;' And here 'tis needful we distinguish well. The Providence, which governeth the world With counsel, wherein all created vision 329 Is vanquished ere it reach unto the bottom, (So that towards her own Beloved might go The bride of Him who, uttering a loud cry, Espoused her with his consecrated blood, Self-confident and unto Him more faithful,) Two Princes did ordain in her behoof, Which on this side and that might be her guide. The one was all seraphical in ardour; The other by his wisdom upon earth A splendour was of light cherubical. One will I speak of, for of both is spoken In praising one, whichever may be taken, Because unto one end their labours were. Between Tupino and the stream that falls Down from the hill elect of blessed Ubald, A fertile slope of lofty mountain hangs, From which Perugia feels the cold and heat Through Porta Sole, and behind it weep Gualdo and Nocera their grievous yoke. From out that slope, there where it breaketh most Its steepness, rose upon the world a sun As this one does sometimes from out the Ganges; Therefore let him who speaketh of that place, Say not Ascesi, for he would say little, But Orient, if he properly would speak. He was not yet far distant from his rising Before he had begun to make the earth Some comfort from his mighty virtue feel. For he in youth his father's wrath incurred For certain Dame, to whom, as unto death, The gate of pleasure no one doth unlock; And was before his spiritual court 'Et coram patre' unto her united; Then day by day more fervently he loved her. She, reft of her first husband, scorned, obscure, One thousand and one hundred years and more, Waited without a suitor till he came. Naught it availed to hear, that with Amyclas Found her unmoved at sounding of his voice He who struck terror into all the world; 330 \nNaught it availed being constant and undaunted, So that, when Mary still remained below, She mounted up with Christ upon the cross. But that too darkly I may not proceed, Francis and Poverty for these two lovers Take thou henceforward in my speech diffuse. Their concord and their joyous semblances, The love, the wonder, and the sweet regard, They made to be the cause of holy thoughts; So much so that the venerable Bernard First bared his feet, and after so great peace Ran, and, in running, thought himself too slow. O wealth unknown! O veritable good! Giles bares his feet, and bares his feet Sylvester Behind the bridegroom, so doth please the bride! Then goes his way that father and that master, He and his Lady and that family Which now was girding on the humble cord; Nor cowardice of heart weighed down his brow At being son of Peter Bernardone, Nor for appearing marvellously scorned; But regally his hard determination To Innocent he opened, and from him Received the primal seal upon his Order. After the people mendicant increased Behind this man, whose admirable life Better in glory of the heavens were sung, Incoronated with a second crown Was through Honorius by the Eternal Spirit The holy purpose of this Archimandrite. And when he had, through thirst of martyrdom, In the proud presence of the Sultan preached Christ and the others who came after him, And, finding for conversion too unripe The folk, and not to tarry there in vain, Returned to fruit of the Italic grass, On the rude rock 'twixt Tiber and the Arno From Christ did he receive the final seal, Which during two whole years his members bore. When He, who chose him unto so much good, 331 \nWas pleased to draw him up to the reward That he had merited by being lowly, Unto his friars, as to the rightful heirs, His most dear Lady did he recommend, And bade that they should love her faithfully; And from her bosom the illustrious soul Wished to depart, returning to its realm, And for its body wished no other bier. Think now what man was he, who was a fit Companion over the high seas to keep The bark of Peter to its proper bearings. And this man was our Patriarch; hence whoever Doth follow him as he commands can see That he is laden with good merchandise. But for new pasturage his flock has grown So greedy, that it is impossible They be not scattered over fields diverse; And in proportion as his sheep remote And vagabond go farther off from him, More void of milk return they to the fold. Verily some there are that fear a hurt, And keep close to the shepherd; but so few, That little cloth doth furnish forth their hoods. Now if my utterance be not indistinct, If thine own hearing hath attentive been, If thou recall to mind what I have said, In part contented shall thy wishes be; For thou shalt see the plant that's chipped away, And the rebuke that lieth in the words, 'Where well one fattens, if he strayeth not.'\" 332",

And as are spanned athwart a tender cloud Two rainbows parallel and like in colour, When Juno to her handmaid gives command, (The one without born of the one within, Like to the speaking of that vagrant one Whom love consumed as doth the sun the vapours,) And make the people here, through covenant God set with Noah, presageful of the world That shall no more be covered with a flood, In such wise of those sempiternal roses The garlands twain encompassed us about, And thus the outer to the inner answered. After the dance, and other grand rejoicings, Both of the singing, and the flaming forth Effulgence with effulgence blithe and tender, Together, at once, with one accord had stopped, (Even as the eyes, that, as volition moves them, Must needs together shut and lift themselves,) Out of the heart of one of the new lights 333 There came a voice, that needle to the star Made me appear in turning thitherward. And it began: \"The love that makes me fair Draws me to speak about the other leader, By whom so well is spoken here of mine. 'Tis right, where one is, to bring in the other, That, as they were united in their warfare, Together likewise may their glory shine. The soldiery of Christ, which it had cost So dear to arm again, behind the standard Moved slow and doubtful and in numbers few, When the Emperor who reigneth evermore Provided for the host that was in peril, Through grace alone and not that it was worthy; And, as was said, he to his Bride brought succour With champions twain, at whose deed, at whose word The straggling people were together drawn. Within that region where the sweet west wind Rises to open the new leaves, wherewith Europe is seen to clothe herself afresh, Not far off from the beating of the waves, Behind which in his long career the sun Sometimes conceals himself from every man, Is situate the fortunate Calahorra, Under protection of the mighty shield In which the Lion subject is and sovereign. Therein was born the amorous paramour Of Christian Faith, the athlete consecrate, Kind to his own and cruel to his foes; And when it was created was his mind Replete with such a living energy, That in his mother her it made prophetic. As soon as the espousals were complete Between him and the Faith at holy font, Where they with mutual safety dowered each other, The woman, who for him had given assent, Saw in a dream the admirable fruit That issue would from him and from his heirs; And that he might be construed as he was, A spirit from this place went forth to name him 334 \nWith His possessive whose he wholly was. Dominic was he called; and him I speak of Even as of the husbandman whom Christ Elected to his garden to assist him. Envoy and servant sooth he seemed of Christ, For the first love made manifest in him Was the first counsel that was given by Christ. Silent and wakeful many a time was he Discovered by his nurse upon the ground, As if he would have said, 'For this I came.' O thou his father, Felix verily! O thou his mother, verily Joanna, If this, interpreted, means as is said! Not for the world which people toil for now In following Ostiense and Taddeo, But through his longing after the true manna, He in short time became so great a teacher, That he began to go about the vineyard, Which fadeth soon, if faithless be the dresser; And of the See, (that once was more benignant Unto the righteous poor, not through itself, But him who sits there and degenerates,) Not to dispense or two or three for six, Not any fortune of first vacancy, 'Non decimas quae sunt pauperum Dei,' He asked for, but against the errant world Permission to do battle for the seed, Of which these four and twenty plants surround thee. Then with the doctrine and the will together, With office apostolical he moved, Like torrent which some lofty vein out-presses; And in among the shoots heretical His impetus with greater fury smote, Wherever the resistance was the greatest. Of him were made thereafter divers runnels, Whereby the garden catholic is watered, So that more living its plantations stand. If such the one wheel of the Biga was, In which the Holy Church itself defended And in the field its civic battle won, 335 \nTruly full manifest should be to thee The excellence of the other, unto whom Thomas so courteous was before my coming. But still the orbit, which the highest part Of its circumference made, is derelict, So that the mould is where was once the crust. His family, that had straight forward moved With feet upon his footprints, are turned round So that they set the point upon the heel. And soon aware they will be of the harvest Of this bad husbandry, when shall the tares Complain the granary is taken from them. Yet say I, he who searcheth leaf by leaf Our volume through, would still some page discover Where he could read, 'I am as I am wont.' 'Twill not be from Casal nor Acquasparta, From whence come such unto the written word That one avoids it, and the other narrows.

There sang they neither Bacchus, nor Apollo, But in the divine nature Persons three, And in one person the divine and human. The singing and the dance fulfilled their measure, And unto us those holy lights gave need, 337 Growing in happiness from care to care. Then broke the silence of those saints concordant The light in which the admirable life Of God's own mendicant was told to me, And said: \"Now that one straw is trodden out Now that its seed is garnered up already, Sweet love invites me to thresh out the other. Into that bosom, thou believest, whence Was drawn the rib to form the beauteous cheek Whose taste to all the world is costing dear, And into that which, by the lance transfixed, Before and since, such satisfaction made That it weighs down the balance of all sin, Whate'er of light it has to human nature Been lawful to possess was all infused By the same power that both of them created; And hence at what I said above dost wonder, When I narrated that no second had The good which in the fifth light is enclosed. Now ope thine eyes to what I answer thee, And thou shalt see thy creed and my discourse Fit in the truth as centre in a circle. That which can die, and that which dieth not, Are nothing but the splendour of the idea Which by his love our Lord brings into being; Because that living Light, which from its fount Effulgent flows, so that it disunites not From Him nor from the Love in them intrined, Through its own goodness reunites its rays In nine subsistences, as in a mirror, Itself eternally remaining One. Thence it descends to the last potencies, Downward from act to act becoming such That only brief contingencies it makes; And these contingencies I hold to be Things generated, which the heaven produces By its own motion, with seed and without. Neither their wax, nor that which tempers it, Remains immutable, and hence beneath The ideal signet more and less shines through; 338 \nTherefore it happens, that the selfsame tree After its kind bears worse and better fruit, And ye are born with characters diverse. If in perfection tempered were the wax, And were the heaven in its supremest virtue, The brilliance of the seal would all appear; But nature gives it evermore deficient, In the like manner working as the artist, Who has the skill of art and hand that trembles. If then the fervent Love, the Vision clear, Of primal Virtue do dispose and seal, Perfection absolute is there acquired. Thus was of old the earth created worthy Of all and every animal perfection; And thus the Virgin was impregnate made; So that thine own opinion I commend, That human nature never yet has been, Nor will be, what it was in those two persons. Now if no farther forth I should proceed, 'Then in what way was he without a peer?' Would be the first beginning of thy words. But, that may well appear what now appears not, Think who he was, and what occasion moved him To make request, when it was told him, 'Ask.' I've not so spoken that thou canst not see Clearly he was a king who asked for wisdom, That he might be sufficiently a king; 'Twas not to know the number in which are The motors here above, or if 'necesse' With a contingent e'er 'necesse' make, 'Non si est dare primum motum esse,' Or if in semicircle can be made Triangle so that it have no right angle. Whence, if thou notest this and what I said, A regal prudence is that peerless seeing In which the shaft of my intention strikes. And if on 'rose' thou turnest thy clear eyes, Thou'lt see that it has reference alone To kings who're many, and the good are rare. With this distinction take thou what I said, 339 \nAnd thus it can consist with thy belief Of the first father and of our Delight. And lead shall this be always to thy feet, To make thee, like a weary man, move slowly Both to the Yes and No thou seest not; For very low among the fools is he Who affirms without distinction, or denies, As well in one as in the other case; Because it happens that full often bends Current opinion in the false direction, And then the feelings bind the intellect. Far more than uselessly he leaves the shore, (Since he returneth not the same he went,) Who fishes for the truth, and has no skill; And in the world proofs manifest thereof Parmenides, Melissus, Brissus are, And many who went on and knew not whither; Thus did Sabellius, Arius, and those fools Who have been even as swords unto the Scriptures In rendering distorted their straight faces. Nor yet shall people be too confident In judging, even as he is who doth count The corn in field or ever it be ripe. For I have seen all winter long the thorn First show itself intractable and fierce, And after bear the rose upon its top; And I have seen a ship direct and swift Run o'er the sea throughout its course entire, To perish at the harbour's mouth at last. Let not Dame Bertha nor Ser Martin think, Seeing one steal, another offering make, To see them in the arbitrament divine; For one may rise, and fall the other may.\" 340",
      "modern": "Let me complete that passage. Here's the modern translation of the opening of Paradiso Canto 13:\n\nLet anyone who wants to truly understand\nwhat I saw next\nimagine fifteen of the brightest stars\nthat bring life to the night sky\nscattered across different regions of heaven,\nimagine that constellation we call the Great Bear\nthat stays within our northern sky\nboth day and night,\nso that it never disappears\nas our world turns on its axis,\nimagine the bright mouth of the horn\nthat begins at the tip of the axle\naround which the first sphere revolves—\n\nimagine all of these stars\nforming themselves into two circles,\nlike the crown that Ariadne made\nwhen she felt the chill of death,\none ring of light spinning within the other,\nboth turning in perfect harmony,\none circle moving clockwise,\nthe other counter-clockwise—\n\nand even then you'd have only a pale shadow\nof the true constellation\nand the double dance\nI witnessed there,\nas far beyond our earthly experience\nas the swiftest heaven\nis beyond the slow movement\nof the river Chiana.\n\nNow I saw—and let the reader hold this image\nfirm as bedrock in his mind—\nthe fifteen brightest stars that kindle heaven\nin all its regions with such blazing light\nit cuts through every veil of earthly air.\n\nPicture the Great Bear, that constellation\nour dome of sky contains both night and day,\nso that it never fades as the pole turns.\nImagine the bright mouth of that great horn\nthat starts where the axis meets its point,\naround which the first sphere revolves—\n\nPicture these forming two signs in the heavens,\nlike the crown that Ariadne made\nthe moment death's cold touch fell on her.\nOne circle holds its rays within the other,\nboth whirling in such perfect motion\nthat one spins forward, one spins back.\n\nThen you might glimpse some shadow of that\ntrue constellation, that double dance\ncircling the point where I now stood—\nfor it surpasses our experience\nas much as the swiftest heaven outpaces\nthe sluggish crawling of the Chiana River.\n\nThere they sang neither of Bacchus nor Apollo,\nbut of three Persons in the divine nature,\nand divine and human joined in one Person.\nThe singing and the dancing reached completion,\nand those holy lights turned toward us,\njoy deepening as they moved from care to care.\n\nThen the silence of that blessed harmony broke,\nand the light that had told me the wondrous story\nof God's own beggar saint began to speak:\n\n\"Now that one sheaf is threshed,\nits grain already stored away,\nsweet love compels me to thresh the other.\n\nYou believe that into the breast\nfrom which the rib was drawn\nto form that lovely face whose taste\ncosts all the world so dear,\nand into that breast which, pierced by the lance,\ngave such satisfaction before and after\nit outweighs the balance of all sin—\ninto both these, whatever light\nit was lawful for human nature to possess\nwas poured by the same Power that made them both.\n\nSo you wonder at what I said before:\nthat no second ever equaled\nthe good enclosed within the fifth light.\n\nOpen your eyes now to my answer,\nand you will see your belief and my words\nfit together like center in a circle.\n\nAll that can die and all that cannot die\nare nothing but the radiance of that Idea\nwhich our Lord brings forth through love.\nThat living Light which streams effulgent\nfrom its Source, never separating\nfrom Him or from the Love entwined in them,\nthrough its own goodness gathers its rays\ninto nine orders, as in mirrors,\nwhile remaining eternally One.\n\nFrom there it descends to the lowest powers,\nmoving downward from act to act,\nuntil it creates only brief contingencies—\nby which I mean those generated things\nthat heaven produces through its motion,\nwith seed or without seed.\n\nNeither their matter nor what shapes it\nstays unchanging, and so beneath\nthe ideal seal, more and less shine through.\nThis is why the same tree,\ntrue to its species, bears both\nworse fruit and better fruit,\nand why you are born with different natures.\n\nIf the matter were perfectly prepared\nand heaven were at its highest power,\nthe seal's full brilliance would appear.\nBut nature always gives imperfectly,\nworking like an artist who masters\nthe craft but has a trembling hand.\n\nYet when fervent Love and the clear Vision\nof that first Power both shape and seal,\nthen absolute perfection is achieved.\nThis is how earth was made worthy\nof every animal's perfection,\nand how the Virgin was made fruitful.\n\nSo I approve your belief\nthat human nature never was,\nnor ever will be, what it was in those two.\n\nNow if I went no further,\nyour first words would be:\n'Then how was Solomon without peer?'\n\nBut to make clear what now seems hidden,\nthink who he was, and what moved him\nto ask when he was told, 'Request.'\nI have not spoken so obscurely\nthat you cannot see clearly\nhe was a king who asked for wisdom\nto be a king worthy of his calling.\n\nHe did not ask to know the number\nof the moving spirits here above,\nor whether necessity combined\nwith contingency ever makes necessity,\nor whether 'there must be a first motion,'\nor whether in a semicircle\nyou can construct a triangle\nwith no right angle.\n\nSo if you note this and what I said before,\nit was kingly prudence—that peerless insight—\nat which my arrow aimed.\nAnd if you turn your clear eyes to 'arose,'\nyou will see it refers only\nto kings, who are many, though few are good.\n\nTake what I said with this distinction,\nand it can stand with your belief\nabout our first father and our Beloved.\n\nLet this always weight your feet like lead,\nmaking you move slowly, like one weary,\ntoward any Yes or No you do not see clearly.\nAmong fools, those rank lowest\nwho affirm or deny without distinction,\nwhether in one case or another—\nfor it often happens that hasty opinion\nbends toward falsehood,\nand then emotion binds the intellect.\n\nMore than uselessly does one leave shore\nwho fishes for truth without skill—\nhe does not return the same as when he left.\nThe world holds clear proof of this:\nParmenides, Melissus, Brissus,\nand many others who went on\nnot knowing where they headed.\nSo did Sabellius and Arius\nand those fools who became like swords\nagainst Scripture, distorting\nits straight features into crooked ones.\n\nLet people not be too confident in judging,\nlike one who counts the grain in a field\nbefore it ripens.\nI have seen the thornbush\nshow itself harsh and forbidding all winter,\nthen later bear the rose at its crown.\nI have seen a ship run straight and swift\nacross the sea through its entire voyage,\nonly to perish at the harbor's mouth.\n\nLet not Mistress Bertha or Master Martin think,\nseeing one person steal and another give offerings,\nthat they see them as God's judgment sees—\nfor one may rise while the other falls.\"",

      "original": "From centre unto rim, from rim to centre, In a round vase the water moves itself, As from without 'tis struck or from within. Into my mind upon a sudden dropped What I am saying, at the moment when Silent became the glorious life of Thomas, Because of the resemblance that was born Of his discourse and that of Beatrice, Whom, after him, it pleased thus to begin: \"This man has need (and does not tell you so, Nor with the voice, nor even in his thought) Of going to the root of one truth more. Declare unto him if the light wherewith Blossoms your substance shall remain with you Eternally the same that it is now; And if it do remain, say in what manner, After ye are again made visible, It can be that it injure not your sight.\" As by a greater gladness urged and drawn They who are dancing in a ring sometimes Uplift their voices and their motions quicken; So, at that orison devout and prompt, The holy circles a new joy displayed In their revolving and their wondrous song. Whoso lamenteth him that here we die That we may live above, has never there Seen the refreshment of the eternal rain. 341 The One and Two and Three who ever liveth, And reigneth ever in Three and Two and One, Not circumscribed and all things circumscribing, Three several times was chanted by each one Among those spirits, with such melody That for all merit it were just reward; And, in the lustre most divine of all The lesser ring, I heard a modest voice, Such as perhaps the Angel's was to Mary, Answer: \"As long as the festivity Of Paradise shall be, so long our love Shall radiate round about us such a vesture. Its brightness is proportioned to the ardour, The ardour to the vision; and the vision Equals what grace it has above its worth. When, glorious and sanctified, our flesh Is reassumed, then shall our persons be More pleasing by their being all complete; For will increase whate'er bestows on us Of light gratuitous the Good Supreme, Light which enables us to look on Him; Therefore the vision must perforce increase, Increase the ardour which from that is kindled, Increase the radiance which from this proceeds. But even as a coal that sends forth flame, And by its vivid whiteness overpowers it So that its own appearance it maintains, Thus the effulgence that surrounds us now Shall be o'erpowered in aspect by the flesh, Which still to-day the earth doth cover up; Nor can so great a splendour weary us, For strong will be the organs of the body To everything which hath the power to please us.\" So sudden and alert appeared to me Both one and the other choir to say Amen, That well they showed desire for their dead bodies; Nor sole for them perhaps, but for the mothers, The fathers, and the rest who had been dear Or ever they became eternal flames. And lo! all round about of equal brightness 342 \nArose a lustre over what was there, Like an horizon that is clearing up. And as at rise of early eve begin Along the welkin new appearances, So that the sight seems real and unreal, It seemed to me that new subsistences Began there to be seen, and make a circle Outside the other two circumferences. O very sparkling of the Holy Spirit, How sudden and incandescent it became Unto mine eyes, that vanquished bore it not! But Beatrice so beautiful and smiling Appeared to me, that with the other sights That followed not my memory I must leave her. Then to uplift themselves mine eyes resumed The power, and I beheld myself translated To higher salvation with my Lady only. Well was I ware that I was more uplifted By the enkindled smiling of the star, That seemed to me more ruddy than its wont. With all my heart, and in that dialect Which is the same in all, such holocaust To God I made as the new grace beseemed; And not yet from my bosom was exhausted The ardour of sacrifice, before I knew This offering was accepted and auspicious; For with so great a lustre and so red Splendours appeared to me in twofold rays, I said: \"O Helios who dost so adorn them!\" Even as distinct with less and greater lights Glimmers between the two poles of the world The Galaxy that maketh wise men doubt, Thus constellated in the depths of Mars, Those rays described the venerable sign That quadrants joining in a circle make. Here doth my memory overcome my genius; For on that cross as levin gleamed forth Christ, So that I cannot find ensample worthy; But he who takes his cross and follows Christ Again will pardon me what I omit, 343 \nSeeing in that aurora lighten Christ. From horn to horn, and 'twixt the top and base, Lights were in motion, brightly scintillating As they together met and passed each other; Thus level and aslant and swift and slow We here behold, renewing still the sight, The particles of bodies long and short, Across the sunbeam move, wherewith is listed Sometimes the shade, which for their own defence People with cunning and with art contrive. And as a lute and harp, accordant strung With many strings, a dulcet tinkling make To him by whom the notes are not distinguished, So from the lights that there to me appeared Upgathered through the cross a melody, Which rapt me, not distinguishing the hymn. Well was I ware it was of lofty laud, Because there came to me, \"Arise and conquer!\" As unto him who hears and comprehends not. So much enamoured I became therewith, That until then there was not anything That e'er had fettered me with such sweet bonds. Perhaps my word appears somewhat too bold, Postponing the delight of those fair eyes, Into which gazing my desire has rest; But who bethinks him that the living seals Of every beauty grow in power ascending, And that I there had not turned round to those, Can me excuse, if I myself accuse To excuse myself, and see that I speak truly: For here the holy joy is not disclosed, Because ascending it becomes more pure. 344",
      "modern": "Like water in a round bowl moving from center to rim,\nfrom rim to center, whether struck from outside or within—\nthis image suddenly dropped into my mind\nwhen Thomas fell silent, his glorious voice stilled.\n\nThe resemblance struck me between his words\nand those of Beatrice, who after him was pleased to begin:\n\"This man has need—though he does not tell you so,\nnot with his voice, nor even in his thought—\nto reach the root of one more truth.\n\nTell him whether the light that makes\nyour substance bloom will remain with you\neternally as it is now.\nAnd if it does remain, explain how,\nwhen you are made visible again,\nit will not injure your sight.\"\n\nLike dancers in a ring who, urged by greater joy,\nlift their voices and quicken their steps,\nso at this devout and eager prayer\nthe holy circles showed new happiness\nin their turning and their wondrous song.\n\nAnyone who mourns that we die here\nso we might live above has never seen there\nthe refreshment of eternal rain.\n\nThe One and Two and Three who lives forever,\nwho reigns always in Three and Two and One,\nuncircumscribed yet circumscribing all things—\nthis was sung three times by each spirit\nwith such melody that it would be\njust reward for any merit.\n\nAnd from the most divine light\nin the smaller ring, I heard a gentle voice—\nperhaps like the angel's voice to Mary—answer:\n\"As long as Paradise's celebration lasts,\njust so long will our love radiate\naround us like this garment of light.\n\nIts brightness matches our ardor,\nour ardor matches our vision,\nand our vision equals whatever grace\nwe have beyond our worth.\n\nWhen our flesh, glorious and sanctified,\nis taken up again, our persons\nwill be more pleasing by being complete.\nWhat the Supreme Good grants us\nof gratuitous light will increase—\nlight that lets us look upon Him.\n\nTherefore our vision must increase,\nthe ardor kindled from that vision must increase,\nthe radiance flowing from that ardor must increase.\n\nBut like a glowing coal that sends forth flame\nyet overpowers it with vivid whiteness\nso its own appearance is preserved,\nso the effulgence surrounding us now\nwill be overpowered by our flesh,\nwhich earth still covers today.\n\nSuch great splendor cannot weary us—\nour bodily organs will be strong enough\nfor everything that has power to please us.\"\n\nSo sudden and eager both choirs appeared\nto say \"Amen\" that they clearly showed\ntheir longing for their dead bodies—\nnot only for themselves, perhaps,\nbut for mothers, fathers, and all others\nwho were dear before they became eternal flames.\n\nAnd look! All around, of equal brightness,\na light arose over what was there,\nlike a horizon clearing at dawn.\n\nAs at early evening new appearances\nbegin along the sky, seeming real yet unreal,\nso it seemed new beings began\nto be visible there, forming a circle\noutside the other two rings.\n\nO brilliant sparkling of the Holy Spirit!\nHow sudden and blazing it became\nto my eyes, which could not bear it!\n\nBut Beatrice appeared so beautiful and smiling\nthat I must leave her with those other sights\nmy memory cannot follow.\n\nThen my eyes resumed their power to rise,\nand I saw myself carried higher\nto greater salvation with my Lady alone.\n\nI knew well I was more uplifted\nby the kindled smile of the star\nthat seemed more red than usual.\n\nWith my whole heart, in that language\ncommon to all, I made such sacrifice\nto God as the new grace deserved.\n\nThe ardor of sacrifice had not yet\nfaded from my breast before I knew\nthis offering was accepted and blessed—\nfor splendors appeared to me\nin double rays of such great light and redness\nthat I cried: \"O sun who adorns them so!\"\n\nAs the Galaxy glimmers between the world's poles\nwith greater and lesser lights,\nmaking wise men wonder,\nso those rays, constellated in Mars's depths,\nformed that venerable sign\nwhere circle-quadrants join to make a cross.\n\nHere memory defeats my skill—\nChrist flashed like lightning on that cross\nso I cannot find a worthy comparison.\nBut whoever takes up his cross and follows Christ\nwill forgive what I leave out,\nseeing Christ blazing in that dawn.\n\nFrom arm to arm, between top and base,\nlights moved in brilliant scintillation,\nsparkling as they met and passed each other.\nJust so we see here, level and slanted,\nswift and slow, constantly changing sight,\nparticles of matter long and short\nmoving through a sunbeam that sometimes\nlists the shadow people contrive\nwith skill and art for their defense.\n\nLike harp and lute strung in harmony\nwith many strings, making sweet music\nfor one who cannot distinguish the notes,\nso from the lights appearing there\na melody gathered through the cross,\nenrapturing me though I could not tell the hymn.\n\nI knew well it was lofty praise\nbecause \"Arise and conquer!\" came to me\nlike words to one who hears but cannot understand.\n\nI became so enamored with this\nthat until then nothing had ever\nbound me with such sweet chains.\n\nPerhaps my words seem too bold,\npostponing the delight of those beautiful eyes\nwhere my desire finds rest when gazing.\nBut anyone who remembers that the living seals\nof all beauty grow stronger as they ascend,\nand that I had not yet turned to look at them,\ncan excuse me—if I accuse myself\nto excuse myself, seeing I speak truly:\nthe holy joy here is not revealed\nbecause ascending makes it more pure.",

A will benign, in which reveals itself Ever the love that righteously inspires, As in the iniquitous, cupidity, Silence imposed upon that dulcet lyre, And quieted the consecrated chords, That Heaven's right hand doth tighten and relax. How unto just entreaties shall be deaf Those substances, which, to give me desire Of praying them, with one accord grew silent? 'Tis well that without end he should lament, Who for the love of thing that doth not last Eternally despoils him of that love! As through the pure and tranquil evening air There shoots from time to time a sudden fire, Moving the eyes that steadfast were before, And seems to be a star that changeth place, Except that in the part where it is kindled Nothing is missed, and this endureth little; So from the horn that to the right extends Unto that cross's foot there ran a star Out of the constellation shining there; Nor was the gem dissevered from its ribbon, But down the radiant fillet ran along, So that fire seemed it behind alabaster. Thus piteous did Anchises' shade reach forward, If any faith our greatest Muse deserve, When in Elysium he his son perceived. \"O sanguis meus, O superinfusa Gratia Dei, sicut tibi, cui Bis unquam Coeli janua reclusa?\" 345 Thus that effulgence; whence I gave it heed; Then round unto my Lady turned my sight, And on this side and that was stupefied; For in her eyes was burning such a smile That with mine own methought I touched the bottom Both of my grace and of my Paradise! Then, pleasant to the hearing and the sight, The spirit joined to its beginning things I understood not, so profound it spake; Nor did it hide itself from me by choice, But by necessity; for its conception Above the mark of mortals set itself. And when the bow of burning sympathy Was so far slackened, that its speech descended Towards the mark of our intelligence, The first thing that was understood by me Was \"Benedight be Thou, O Trine and One, Who hast unto my seed so courteous been!\" And it continued: \"Hunger long and grateful, Drawn from the reading of the mighty volume Wherein is never changed the white nor dark, Thou hast appeased, my son, within this light In which I speak to thee, by grace of her Who to this lofty flight with plumage clothed thee. Thou thinkest that to me thy thought doth pass From Him who is the first, as from the unit, If that be known, ray out the five and six; And therefore who I am thou askest not, And why I seem more joyous unto thee Than any other of this gladsome crowd. Thou think'st the truth; because the small and great Of this existence look into the mirror Wherein, before thou think'st, thy thought thou showest. But that the sacred love, in which I watch With sight perpetual, and which makes me thirst With sweet desire, may better be fulfilled, Now let thy voice secure and frank and glad Proclaim the wishes, the desire proclaim, To which my answer is decreed already.\" To Beatrice I turned me, and she heard 346 \nBefore I spake, and smiled to me a sign, That made the wings of my desire increase; Then in this wise began I: \"Love and knowledge, When on you dawned the first Equality, Of the same weight for each of you became; For in the Sun, which lighted you and burned With heat and radiance, they so equal are, That all similitudes are insufficient. But among mortals will and argument, For reason that to you is manifest, Diversely feathered in their pinions are. Whence I, who mortal am, feel in myself This inequality; so give not thanks, Save in my heart, for this paternal welcome. Truly do I entreat thee, living topaz! Set in this precious jewel as a gem, That thou wilt satisfy me with thy name.\" \"O leaf of mine, in whom I pleasure took E'en while awaiting, I was thine own root!\" Such a beginning he in answer made me. Then said to me: \"That one from whom is named Thy race, and who a hundred years and more Has circled round the mount on the first cornice, A son of mine and thy great-grandsire was; Well it behoves thee that the long fatigue Thou shouldst for him make shorter with thy works. Florence, within the ancient boundary From which she taketh still her tierce and nones, Abode in quiet, temperate and chaste. No golden chain she had, nor coronal, Nor ladies shod with sandal shoon, nor girdle That caught the eye more than the person did. Not yet the daughter at her birth struck fear Into the father, for the time and dower Did not o'errun this side or that the measure. No houses had she void of families, Not yet had thither come Sardanapalus To show what in a chamber can be done; Not yet surpassed had Montemalo been By your Uccellatojo, which surpassed 347 \nShall in its downfall be as in its rise. Bellincion Berti saw I go begirt With leather and with bone, and from the mirror His dame depart without a painted face; And him of Nerli saw, and him of Vecchio, Contented with their simple suits of buff And with the spindle and the flax their dames. O fortunate women! and each one was certain Of her own burial-place, and none as yet For sake of France was in her bed deserted. One o'er the cradle kept her studious watch, And in her lullaby the language used That first delights the fathers and the mothers; Another, drawing tresses from her distaff, Told o'er among her family the tales Of Trojans and of Fesole and Rome. As great a marvel then would have been held A Lapo Salterello, a Cianghella, As Cincinnatus or Cornelia now. To such a quiet, such a beautiful Life of the citizen, to such a safe Community, and to so sweet an inn, Did Mary give me, with loud cries invoked, And in your ancient Baptistery at once Christian and Cacciaguida I became. Moronto was my brother, and Eliseo; From Val di Pado came to me my wife, And from that place thy surname was derived. I followed afterward the Emperor Conrad, And he begirt me of his chivalry, So much I pleased him with my noble deeds. I followed in his train against that law's Iniquity, whose people doth usurp Your just possession, through your Pastor's fault.

      "original": "O thou our poor nobility of blood, If thou dost make the people glory in thee Down here where our affection languishes, A marvellous thing it ne'er will be to me; For there where appetite is not perverted, I say in Heaven, of thee I made a boast! Truly thou art a cloak that quickly shortens, So that unless we piece thee day by day Time goeth round about thee with his shears! With 'You,' which Rome was first to tolerate, (Wherein her family less perseveres,) Yet once again my words beginning made; Whence Beatrice, who stood somewhat apart, Smiling, appeared like unto her who coughed At the first failing writ of Guenever. And I began: \"You are my ancestor, You give to me all hardihood to speak, You lift me so that I am more than I. So many rivulets with gladness fill My mind, that of itself it makes a joy Because it can endure this and not burst. Then tell me, my beloved root ancestral, Who were your ancestors, and what the years That in your boyhood chronicled themselves? Tell me about the sheepfold of Saint John, How large it was, and who the people were Within it worthy of the highest seats.\" As at the blowing of the winds a coal Quickens to flame, so I beheld that light 349 Become resplendent at my blandishments. And as unto mine eyes it grew more fair, With voice more sweet and tender, but not in This modern dialect, it said to me: \"From uttering of the 'Ave,' till the birth In which my mother, who is now a saint, Of me was lightened who had been her burden, Unto its Lion had this fire returned Five hundred fifty times and thirty more, To reinflame itself beneath his paw. My ancestors and I our birthplace had Where first is found the last ward of the city By him who runneth in your annual game. Suffice it of my elders to hear this; But who they were, and whence they thither came, Silence is more considerate than speech. All those who at that time were there between Mars and the Baptist, fit for bearing arms, Were a fifth part of those who now are living; But the community, that now is mixed With Campi and Certaldo and Figghine, Pure in the lowest artisan was seen. O how much better 'twere to have as neighbours The folk of whom I speak, and at Galluzzo And at Trespiano have your boundary, Than have them in the town, and bear the stench Of Aguglione's churl, and him of Signa Who has sharp eyes for trickery already. Had not the folk, which most of all the world Degenerates, been a step-dame unto Caesar, But as a mother to her son benignant, Some who turn Florentines, and trade and discount, Would have gone back again to Simifonte There where their grandsires went about as beggars. At Montemurlo still would be the Counts, The Cerchi in the parish of Acone, Perhaps in Valdigrieve the Buondelmonti. Ever the intermingling of the people Has been the source of malady in cities, As in the body food it surfeits on; 350 \nAnd a blind bull more headlong plunges down Than a blind lamb; and very often cuts Better and more a single sword than five. If Luni thou regard, and Urbisaglia, How they have passed away, and how are passing Chiusi and Sinigaglia after them, To hear how races waste themselves away, Will seem to thee no novel thing nor hard, Seeing that even cities have an end. All things of yours have their mortality, Even as yourselves; but it is hidden in some That a long while endure, and lives are short; And as the turning of the lunar heaven Covers and bares the shores without a pause, In the like manner fortune does with Florence. Therefore should not appear a marvellous thing What I shall say of the great Florentines Of whom the fame is hidden in the Past. I saw the Ughi, saw the Catellini, Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi, Even in their fall illustrious citizens; And saw, as mighty as they ancient were, With him of La Sannella him of Arca, And Soldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi. Near to the gate that is at present laden With a new felony of so much weight That soon it shall be jetsam from the bark, The Ravignani were, from whom descended The County Guido, and whoe'er the name Of the great Bellincione since hath taken. He of La Pressa knew the art of ruling Already, and already Galigajo Had hilt and pommel gilded in his house. Mighty already was the Column Vair, Sacchetti, Giuochi, Fifant, and Barucci, And Galli, and they who for the bushel blush. The stock from which were the Calfucci born Was great already, and already chosen To curule chairs the Sizii and Arrigucci. O how beheld I those who are undone 351 \nBy their own pride! and how the Balls of Gold Florence enflowered in all their mighty deeds! So likewise did the ancestors of those Who evermore, when vacant is your church, Fatten by staying in consistory. The insolent race, that like a dragon follows Whoever flees, and unto him that shows His teeth or purse is gentle as a lamb, Already rising was, but from low people; So that it pleased not Ubertin Donato That his wife's father should make him their kin. Already had Caponsacco to the Market From Fesole descended, and already Giuda and Infangato were good burghers. I'll tell a thing incredible, but true; One entered the small circuit by a gate Which from the Della Pera took its name! Each one that bears the beautiful escutcheon Of the great baron whose renown and name The festival of Thomas keepeth fresh, Knighthood and privilege from him received; Though with the populace unites himself To-day the man who binds it with a border. Already were Gualterotti and Importuni; And still more quiet would the Borgo be If with new neighbours it remained unfed. The house from which is born your lamentation, Through just disdain that death among you brought And put an end unto your joyous life, Was honoured in itself and its companions. O Buondelmonte, how in evil hour Thou fled'st the bridal at another's promptings! Many would be rejoicing who are sad, If God had thee surrendered to the Ema The first time that thou camest to the city. But it behoved the mutilated stone Which guards the bridge, that Florence should provide A victim in her latest hour of peace. With all these families, and others with them, Florence beheld I in so great repose, 352 \nThat no occasion had she whence to weep; With all these families beheld so just And glorious her people, that the lily Never upon the spear was placed reversed, Nor by division was vermilion made.\" 353",
      "modern": "O you pathetic nobility of bloodline!\nIf you make people take pride in you\ndown here where our hearts grow cold,\nit will never surprise me—\nfor even in Heaven, where desire runs pure,\nI too once boasted of you!\n\nBut truly you are a cloak that shrinks quickly,\nso that unless we add new cloth each day,\ntime circles around you with his scissors.\n\nWith the formal \"you\" that Rome first allowed—\nthough her people no longer persist in it—\nI began my words once more.\n\nAt this, Beatrice, standing a little apart\nand smiling, looked like the lady who coughed\nat Guinevere's first written sin.\n\nAnd I began: \"You are my ancestor.\nYou give me every courage to speak.\nYou lift me up so I become more than myself.\n\nSo many streams of gladness fill my mind\nthat it creates its own joy\nbecause it can bear this weight and not burst.\n\nSo tell me, my beloved ancestral root:\nWho were your forebears, and what years\nwere recorded in the chronicles of your youth?\n\nTell me about Saint John's sheepfold—\nhow large it was, and who were the people\nwithin it worthy of the highest places.\"\n\nLike a coal quickening to flame\nwhen the wind blows, I saw that light\ngrow brilliant at my loving words.\n\nAnd as it became more beautiful to my eyes,\nwith a voice sweeter and more tender—\nbut not in this modern dialect—it spoke:\n\n\"From the speaking of the 'Ave' to the birth\nin which my mother, now a saint,\ndelivered herself of me, her burden,\n\nthis fire had returned five hundred\nfifty-three times to its Lion\nto rekindle itself beneath his paw.\n\nMy ancestors and I were born\nwhere the runner in your annual race\nfirst reaches the city's final district.\n\nLet it suffice to hear this much of my elders—\nwho they were and where they came from,\nsilence is more gracious than speech.\n\nAll those who lived then between\nMars and the Baptist, fit to bear arms,\nwere one-fifth of those living now.\n\nBut the citizenry, now polluted\nwith Campi, Certaldo, and Figghine,\nwas pure even in its lowest craftsmen.\n\nHow much better to have those people\nI speak of as neighbors, with your borders\nat Galluzzo and Trespiano,\n\nthan to have them inside the city\nand endure the stench of Aguglione's peasant\nand that sharp-eyed schemer from Signa.\n\nIf the people who degenerate\nmost in all the world had not been\na stepmother to Caesar, but kind as a mother to her son,\n\nsome who become Florentines\nand deal in trade and usury\nwould have returned to Simifonte,\n\nwhere their grandfathers wandered as beggars.\nMontemurlo would still have its Counts,\nthe Cerchi would be in Acone parish,\n\nand perhaps the Buondelmonti in Valdigreve.\nThe mixing of peoples has always been\nthe source of cities' sickness,\n\nlike food that overloads the body.\nA blind bull plunges down more recklessly\nthan a blind lamb, and one sword often cuts\n\nbetter and deeper than five.\nIf you look at Luni and Urbisaglia,\nhow they have vanished, and how Chiusi\n\nand Sinigaglia follow after them,\nit will seem nothing strange or difficult\nto hear how families waste away—\n\nsince even cities have their end.\nAll your things have their mortality,\njust as you do, though in some things\n\nthat last long it stays hidden,\nand human lives are brief.\nAs the turning of the moon's sphere\n\ncovers and uncovers shores without pause,\nso fortune does the same with Florence.\nTherefore it should not seem marvelous\n\nwhat I will say about the great Florentines\nwhose fame is buried in the past.\nI saw the Ughi, I saw the Catellini,\n\nthe Filippi, Greci, Ormanni, and Alberichi—\nillustrious citizens even in decline.\nI saw, as great as they were ancient,\n\nthe families of La Sannella and Arca,\nSoldanier, Ardinghi, and Bostichi.\nNear the gate that now bears\n\nthe weight of such fresh treachery\nthat it will soon be thrown from the ship,\nlived the Ravignani, from whom descended\n\nCount Guido and all who have since\ntaken great Bellincione's name.\nHe of La Pressa already knew statecraft,\n\nand Galigajo already had\ngilded hilt and pommel in his house.\nGreat already was the Vair column,\n\nSacchetti, Giuochi, Fifanti, and Barucci,\nand Galli, and those who blush for the false bushel.\nThe stock that bore the Calfucci\n\nwas already great, and the Sizii\nand Arrigucci were already chosen\nfor the curule chairs.\n\nOh, how I saw those ruined\nby their own pride!

      "original": "As came to Clymene, to be made certain Of that which he had heard against himself, He who makes fathers chary still to children, Even such was I, and such was I perceived By Beatrice and by the holy light That first on my account had changed its place. Therefore my Lady said to me: \"Send forth The flame of thy desire, so that it issue Imprinted well with the internal stamp; Not that our knowledge may be greater made By speech of thine, but to accustom thee To tell thy thirst, that we may give thee drink.\" \"O my beloved tree, (that so dost lift thee, That even as minds terrestrial perceive No triangle containeth two obtuse, So thou beholdest the contingent things Ere in themselves they are, fixing thine eyes Upon the point in which all times are present,) While I was with Virgilius conjoined Upon the mountain that the souls doth heal, And when descending into the dead world, Were spoken to me of my future life Some grievous words; although I feel myself In sooth foursquare against the blows of chance. On this account my wish would be content To hear what fortune is approaching me, Because foreseen an arrow comes more slowly.\" Thus did I say unto that selfsame light That unto me had spoken before; and even As Beatrice willed was my own will confessed. 354 Not in vague phrase, in which the foolish folk Ensnared themselves of old, ere yet was slain The Lamb of God who taketh sins away, But with clear words and unambiguous Language responded that paternal love, Hid and revealed by its own proper smile: \"Contingency, that outside of the volume Of your materiality extends not, Is all depicted in the eternal aspect. Necessity however thence it takes not, Except as from the eye, in which 'tis mirrored, A ship that with the current down descends. From thence, e'en as there cometh to the ear Sweet harmony from an organ, comes in sight To me the time that is preparing for thee. As forth from Athens went Hippolytus, By reason of his step-dame false and cruel, So thou from Florence must perforce depart. Already this is willed, and this is sought for; And soon it shall be done by him who thinks it, Where every day the Christ is bought and sold. The blame shall follow the offended party In outcry as is usual; but the vengeance Shall witness to the truth that doth dispense it. Thou shalt abandon everything beloved Most tenderly, and this the arrow is Which first the bow of banishment shoots forth. Thou shalt have proof how savoureth of salt The bread of others, and how hard a road The going down and up another's stairs. And that which most shall weigh upon thy shoulders Will be the bad and foolish company With which into this valley thou shalt fall; For all ingrate, all mad and impious Will they become against thee; but soon after They, and not thou, shall have the forehead scarlet. Of their bestiality their own proceedings Shall furnish proof; so 'twill be well for thee A party to have made thee by thyself. Thine earliest refuge and thine earliest inn 355 \nShall be the mighty Lombard's courtesy, Who on the Ladder bears the holy bird, Who such benign regard shall have for thee That 'twixt you twain, in doing and in asking, That shall be first which is with others last. With him shalt thou see one who at his birth Has by this star of strength been so impressed, That notable shall his achievements be. Not yet the people are aware of him Through his young age, since only nine years yet Around about him have these wheels revolved. But ere the Gascon cheat the noble Henry, Some sparkles of his virtue shall appear In caring not for silver nor for toil. So recognized shall his magnificence Become hereafter, that his enemies Will not have power to keep mute tongues about it. On him rely, and on his benefits; By him shall many people be transformed, Changing condition rich and mendicant; And written in thy mind thou hence shalt bear Of him, but shalt not say it\"—and things said he Incredible to those who shall be present. Then added: \"Son, these are the commentaries On what was said to thee; behold the snares That are concealed behind few revolutions; Yet would I not thy neighbours thou shouldst envy, Because thy life into the future reaches Beyond the punishment of their perfidies.\" When by its silence showed that sainted soul That it had finished putting in the woof Into that web which I had given it warped, Began I, even as he who yearneth after, Being in doubt, some counsel from a person Who seeth, and uprightly wills, and loves: \"Well see I, father mine, how spurreth on The time towards me such a blow to deal me As heaviest is to him who most gives way. Therefore with foresight it is well I arm me, That, if the dearest place be taken from me, 356 \nI may not lose the others by my songs. Down through the world of infinite bitterness, And o'er the mountain, from whose beauteous summit The eyes of my own Lady lifted me, And afterward through heaven from light to light, I have learned that which, if I tell again, Will be a savour of strong herbs to many. And if I am a timid friend to truth, I fear lest I may lose my life with those Who will hereafter call this time the olden.\" The light in which was smiling my own treasure Which there I had discovered, flashed at first As in the sunshine doth a golden mirror; Then made reply: \"A conscience overcast Or with its own or with another's shame, Will taste forsooth the tartness of thy word; But ne'ertheless, all falsehood laid aside, Make manifest thy vision utterly, And let them scratch wherever is the itch; For if thine utterance shall offensive be At the first taste, a vital nutriment 'Twill leave thereafter, when it is digested. This cry of thine shall do as doth the wind, Which smiteth most the most exalted summits, And that is no slight argument of honour. Therefore are shown to thee within these wheels, Upon the mount and in the dolorous valley, Only the souls that unto fame are known; Because the spirit of the hearer rests not, Nor doth confirm its faith by an example Which has the root of it unknown and hidden, Or other reason that is not apparent.\" 357",
      "modern": "Like Phaëthon rushing to Clymene\nto confirm the terrible rumors he had heard about his birth—\nthe youth whose reckless plea still makes fathers\ncautious of their children's desperate requests—\nso I stood there, burning with questions,\nand both Beatrice and the sacred light\nthat had first moved for my sake could see it clearly.\n\nMy lady spoke to me: \"Release the flame\nof your desire, let it emerge\nclearly marked with your heart's true longing—\nnot so we might learn something new\nfrom what you say, but to teach you\nhow to voice your thirst, so we can quench it.\"\n\n\"O my beloved foundation,\" I began,\n\"you who rise so high that just as earthbound minds\ncan see no triangle contains two obtuse angles,\nyou can perceive all contingent things\nbefore they come to pass, your gaze fixed\non that eternal point where every moment converges—\n\nwhile I climbed the mountain that heals souls\nwith Virgil as my guide, and later\nwhen we descended into the world of the dead,\nI heard grave words spoken about my future life.\nThough I feel myself braced and ready\nto stand firm against fortune's blows,\nI would still find comfort in knowing\nwhat trials approach me—\na foreseen arrow strikes with less force.\"\n\nThese words I spoke to that same radiant spirit\nwho had addressed me before, confessing my desire\nexactly as Beatrice wished.\n\nNot in the riddling prophecies that once\nensnared the foolish before the Lamb of God\nwas sacrificed to take away our sins,\nbut in clear words and unmistakable language\nthat paternal love replied,\nboth hidden and revealed in its own luminous smile:\n\n\"Contingency—which extends no further\nthan the boundaries of your material world—\nis perfectly depicted in the eternal vision.\nYet this does not make it necessary,\nany more than a ship sailing downstream\nis compelled by the eye that watches it.\n\nFrom that eternal vantage point,\nas sweet harmony reaches the ear from an organ,\nthe time that awaits you comes into my sight.\n\nJust as Hippolytus was forced to flee Athens\nbecause of his stepmother's lies and cruelty,\nso you must leave Florence against your will.\nThis is already decided, already set in motion,\nand will soon be accomplished by the one\nwho plots it in that place where Christ\nis bought and sold every single day.\n\nAs always happens, the outcry will blame\nthe injured party, but divine vengeance\nwill bear witness to the dispensing truth.\n\nYou will abandon everything you love most dearly—\nthis is the first arrow\nthat exile's bow will shoot.\nYou will learn how bitter\nanother's bread tastes,\nhow hard the path up and down\nanother's stairs.\n\nBut what will weigh most heavily on your shoulders\nis the wicked, foolish company\nyou'll find yourself among in that dark valley.\nThey will all turn against you—\nungrateful, mad, and godless—\nbut soon after, their foreheads, not yours,\nwill burn with shame.\nTheir own actions will prove their brutality,\nso it will serve you well\nto make yourself a party of one.\n\nYour first refuge and shelter\nwill be the great Lombard's generosity—\nhe who bears the sacred eagle on the Ladder—\nwho will regard you with such kindness\nthat between you, in giving and asking,\nwhat usually comes last will come first.\n\nWith him you will meet one who at birth\nwas so powerfully marked by this strong star\nthat his deeds will be extraordinary.\nPeople don't know him yet because of his youth—\nonly nine years have these celestial wheels\nrevolved around him—\nbut before the Gascon deceives noble Henry,\nsparks of his virtue will begin to show\nin his contempt for money and hardship.\n\nHis magnificence will become so renowned\nthat even his enemies won't be able\nto keep silent about it.\nTrust in him and his good works—\nthrough him many people will be transformed,\nrich and poor changing places.\nTake this knowledge with you,\nbut do not speak of it yet\"—\nand he told me things that will seem incredible\neven to those who witness them.\n\nThen he added: \"Son, these are the explanations\nof what was prophesied to you before.\nHere are the snares hidden\nbehind just a few more revolutions of time.\nBut do not envy your neighbors,\nfor your life will extend far beyond\nthe punishment of their betrayals.\"\n\nWhen that blessed soul showed by its silence\nthat it had finished weaving the threads\ninto the pattern I had given it to complete,\nI began like someone who yearns,\nwhile still uncertain, for counsel\nfrom one who sees clearly, wills rightly, and loves:\n\n\"I see clearly, my father, how time races toward me\ncarrying a blow that will fall heaviest\non whoever yields most to it.\nSo it's wise that I arm myself with foresight,\nand if I lose the place most dear to me,\nmay I not lose all others through my songs.\n\nDown through the world of infinite suffering,\nover the mountain from whose beautiful summit\nmy lady's eyes first lifted me,\nand then through heaven from light to light,\nI have learned things that, if I tell them again,\nwill taste bitter as strong herbs to many.\n\nAnd if I prove a timid friend to truth,\nI fear I may not survive among those\nwho will call this present time the distant past.\"\n\nThe light in which my treasure was smiling—\nthe spirit I had discovered there—\nflashed suddenly like a golden mirror in sunlight,\nthen replied:\n\n\"A conscience darkened\nby its own shame or another's\nwill indeed find your words sharp,\nbut nevertheless, setting aside all lies,\nmake your entire vision known\nand let them scratch where it itches.\n\nFor though your message may offend\nat first taste, it will leave behind\nvital nourishment once digested.\nYour cry will act like the wind\nthat strikes hardest the highest peaks—\nand this is no small mark of honor.\n\nThis is why you have been shown,\nwithin these spheres, upon the mountain,\nand in the valley of sorrow,\nonly souls known to fame—\nbecause the listener's spirit will not rest\nor confirm its faith through examples\nwhose roots are unknown and hidden,\nor through arguments that are not clear.\"",

      "original": "Now was alone rejoicing in its word That soul beatified, and I was tasting My own, the bitter tempering with the sweet, And the Lady who to God was leading me Said: \"Change thy thought; consider that I am Near unto Him who every wrong disburdens.\" Unto the loving accents of my comfort I turned me round, and then what love I saw Within those holy eyes I here relinquish; Not only that my language I distrust, But that my mind cannot return so far Above itself, unless another guide it. Thus much upon that point can I repeat, That, her again beholding, my affection From every other longing was released. While the eternal pleasure, which direct Rayed upon Beatrice, from her fair face Contented me with its reflected aspect, Conquering me with the radiance of a smile, She said to me, \"Turn thee about and listen; Not in mine eyes alone is Paradise.\" Even as sometimes here do we behold The affection in the look, if it be such That all the soul is wrapt away by it, So, by the flaming of the effulgence holy To which I turned, I recognized therein The wish of speaking to me somewhat farther. And it began: \"In this fifth resting-place 358 Upon the tree that liveth by its summit, And aye bears fruit, and never loses leaf, Are blessed spirits that below, ere yet They came to Heaven, were of such great renown That every Muse therewith would affluent be. Therefore look thou upon the cross's horns; He whom I now shall name will there enact What doth within a cloud its own swift fire.\" I saw athwart the Cross a splendour drawn By naming Joshua, (even as he did it,) Nor noted I the word before the deed; And at the name of the great Maccabee I saw another move itself revolving, And gladness was the whip unto that top. Likewise for Charlemagne and for Orlando, Two of them my regard attentive followed As followeth the eye its falcon flying. William thereafterward, and Renouard, And the Duke Godfrey, did attract my sight Along upon that Cross, and Robert Guiscard. Then, moved and mingled with the other lights, The soul that had addressed me showed how great An artist 'twas among the heavenly singers. To my right side I turned myself around, My duty to behold in Beatrice Either by words or gesture signified; And so translucent I beheld her eyes, So full of pleasure, that her countenance Surpassed its other and its latest wont. And as, by feeling greater delectation, A man in doing good from day to day Becomes aware his virtue is increasing, So I became aware that my gyration With heaven together had increased its arc, That miracle beholding more adorned. And such as is the change, in little lapse Of time, in a pale woman, when her face Is from the load of bashfulness unladen, Such was it in mine eyes, when I had turned, Caused by the whiteness of the temperate star, 359 \nThe sixth, which to itself had gathered me. Within that Jovial torch did I behold The sparkling of the love which was therein Delineate our language to mine eyes. And even as birds uprisen from the shore, As in congratulation o'er their food, Make squadrons of themselves, now round, now long, So from within those lights the holy creatures Sang flying to and fro, and in their figures Made of themselves now D, now I, now L. First singing they to their own music moved; Then one becoming of these characters, A little while they rested and were silent. O divine Pegasea, thou who genius Dost glorious make, and render it long-lived, And this through thee the cities and the kingdoms, Illume me with thyself, that I may bring Their figures out as I have them conceived! Apparent be thy power in these brief verses! Themselves then they displayed in five times seven Vowels and consonants; and I observed The parts as they seemed spoken unto me. 'Diligite justitiam,' these were First verb and noun of all that was depicted; 'Qui judicatis terram' were the last. Thereafter in the M of the fifth word Remained they so arranged, that Jupiter Seemed to be silver there with gold inlaid. And other lights I saw descend where was The summit of the M, and pause there singing The good, I think, that draws them to itself. Then, as in striking upon burning logs Upward there fly innumerable sparks, Whence fools are wont to look for auguries, More than a thousand lights seemed thence to rise, And to ascend, some more, and others less, Even as the Sun that lights them had allotted; And, each one being quiet in its place, The head and neck beheld I of an eagle Delineated by that inlaid fire. 360 \nHe who there paints has none to be his guide; But Himself guides; and is from Him remembered That virtue which is form unto the nest. The other beatitude, that contented seemed At first to bloom a lily on the M, By a slight motion followed out the imprint. O gentle star! what and how many gems Did demonstrate to me, that all our justice Effect is of that heaven which thou ingemmest! Wherefore I pray the Mind, in which begin Thy motion and thy virtue, to regard Whence comes the smoke that vitiates thy rays; So that a second time it now be wroth With buying and with selling in the temple Whose walls were built with signs and martyrdoms! O soldiery of heaven, whom I contemplate, Implore for those who are upon the earth All gone astray after the bad example! Once 'twas the custom to make war with swords; But now 'tis made by taking here and there The bread the pitying Father shuts from none. Yet thou, who writest but to cancel, think That Peter and that Paul, who for this vineyard Which thou art spoiling died, are still alive! Well canst thou say: \"So steadfast my desire Is unto him who willed to live alone, And for a dance was led to martyrdom, That I know not the Fisherman nor Paul.\" 361",
      "modern": "Now that blessed soul rejoiced alone in its words,\nwhile I savored my own thoughts—\nthe bitter mingled with the sweet.\n\nThe Lady who was leading me to God said:\n\"Change your thinking. Remember that I am\nclose to Him who lifts the burden of every wrong.\"\n\nI turned toward the loving voice of my comfort,\nand what love I saw blazing in those holy eyes\nI cannot tell you here—\nnot only because I distrust my words,\nbut because memory cannot climb back so high\nabove itself without another to guide it.\n\nThis much I can say about that moment:\nwhen I looked at her again, my heart\nwas freed from every other longing.\n\nThe eternal joy that streamed directly\nonto Beatrice satisfied me completely\nwith its reflection from her radiant face.\nConquering me with the brightness of her smile,\nshe said: \"Turn around and listen—\nParadise exists not only in my eyes.\"\n\nJust as we sometimes see emotion\nwritten so clearly in a person's expression\nthat it captures the whole soul,\nso in the flaming of that holy radiance\nI turned toward, I recognized\nthe desire to speak with me further.\n\nAnd it began: \"In this fifth resting place,\nhigh on the tree that draws life from its crown\nand always bears fruit, never losing leaves,\ndwell blessed spirits who below on earth,\nbefore they came to Heaven, won such fame\nthat any poem would be enriched by their stories.\n\nLook now upon the arms of the cross—\neach one I name will flash like lightning\nstreaking swift fire through a cloud.\"\n\nI saw a splendor sweep across the Cross\nwhen Joshua's name was spoken—\nthe deed happened even as the word was said.\nAt the name of the great Maccabee\nI saw another spirit spinning with joy,\ngladness itself the whip driving that top.\n\nCharlemagne and Roland claimed my attention next—\nmy gaze followed them both intently\nas the eye tracks its falcon's flight.\n\nThen William, Renouard, Duke Godfrey,\nand Robert Guiscard drew my sight\nalong the length of that bright Cross.\n\nThe soul that had been speaking to me\nmoved and mingled with the other lights,\nshowing what artistry it possessed\namong the heavenly choir.\n\nI turned to my right side\nto see what duty Beatrice might signal\nthrough word or gesture.\nHer eyes were so clear, so full of joy,\nthat her expression surpassed\nall its previous radiance.\n\nAs a person doing good from day to day\nbecomes aware through growing delight\nthat virtue is increasing within,\nso I realized that my circling path\nwith heaven had widened its arc\nwhen I beheld that miracle made more beautiful.\n\nLike the swift change in a pale woman's face\nwhen it's suddenly freed\nfrom the weight of bashfulness—\nsuch was the change my eyes witnessed\nwhen I turned, caused by the white light\nof the temperate sixth star that gathered me in.\n\nWithin that torch of Jupiter I saw\nthe sparkling of the love dwelling there\ntrace out our human language before my eyes.\n\nLike birds rising from the riverbank,\nseeming to celebrate their feeding,\nforming flocks now round, now stretched long,\nso the holy creatures sang\nas they flew back and forth within those lights.\nIn their formations they spelled out\nnow D, now I, now L.\n\nFirst they moved singing to their own music,\nthen becoming one of these letters,\nthey paused briefly in silence.\n\nO divine Pegasus, you who make genius\nglorious and grant it long life,\nand through you do the same for cities and kingdoms—\nilluminate me with your light so I may capture\nthese shapes as I have conceived them!\nLet your power shine through these few verses!\n\nThe spirits arranged themselves\nin five times seven vowels and consonants,\nand I observed each part\nas it seemed to speak to me.\n\n\"DILIGITE JUSTITIAM\" appeared first—\nverb and noun of all that was depicted.\n\"QUI JUDICATIS TERRAM\" came last.\n\nThen in the M of the fifth word\nthey remained so perfectly arranged\nthat Jupiter seemed silver inlaid with gold.\n\nI saw other lights descend\nto the summit of the M and pause there,\nsinging of the good that draws them to itself.\n\nThen, like countless sparks\nflying upward when burning logs are struck—\nsparks that fools read as omens—\nmore than a thousand lights seemed to rise\nand ascend, some higher, others lower,\nas the Sun that kindles them decreed.\n\nWhen each had settled in its place,\nI saw outlined in that inlaid fire\nthe head and neck of an eagle.\n\nHe who paints there needs no guide\nbut guides Himself, and from Him flows\nthat power which shapes the nest.\n\nThe other blessed spirits, who at first\nseemed content to bloom like lilies on the M,\ncompleted the design with a slight movement.\n\nO gentle star!

      "original": "Appeared before me with its wings outspread The beautiful image that in sweet fruition Made jubilant the interwoven souls; Appeared a little ruby each, wherein Ray of the sun was burning so enkindled That each into mine eyes refracted it. And what it now behoves me to retrace Nor voice has e'er reported, nor ink written, Nor was by fantasy e'er comprehended; For speak I saw, and likewise heard, the beak, And utter with its voice both 'I' and 'My,' When in conception it was 'We' and 'Our.' And it began: \"Being just and merciful Am I exalted here unto that glory Which cannot be exceeded by desire; And upon earth I left my memory Such, that the evil-minded people there Commend it, but continue not the story.\" So doth a single heat from many embers Make itself felt, even as from many loves Issued a single sound from out that image. Whence I thereafter: \"O perpetual flowers Of the eternal joy, that only one Make me perceive your odours manifold, Exhaling, break within me the great fast Which a long season has in hunger held me, Not finding for it any food on earth. Well do I know, that if in heaven its mirror Justice Divine another realm doth make, 362 Yours apprehends it not through any veil. You know how I attentively address me To listen; and you know what is the doubt That is in me so very old a fast.\" Even as a falcon, issuing from his hood, Doth move his head, and with his wings applaud him, Showing desire, and making himself fine, Saw I become that standard, which of lauds Was interwoven of the grace divine, With such songs as he knows who there rejoices. Then it began: \"He who a compass turned On the world's outer verge, and who within it Devised so much occult and manifest, Could not the impress of his power so make On all the universe, as that his Word Should not remain in infinite excess. And this makes certain that the first proud being, Who was the paragon of every creature, By not awaiting light fell immature. And hence appears it, that each minor nature Is scant receptacle unto that good Which has no end, and by itself is measured. In consequence our vision, which perforce Must be some ray of that intelligence With which all things whatever are replete, Cannot in its own nature be so potent, That it shall not its origin discern Far beyond that which is apparent to it. Therefore into the justice sempiternal The power of vision that your world receives, As eye into the ocean, penetrates; Which, though it see the bottom near the shore, Upon the deep perceives it not, and yet 'Tis there, but it is hidden by the depth. There is no light but comes from the serene That never is o'ercast, nay, it is darkness Or shadow of the flesh, or else its poison. Amply to thee is opened now the cavern Which has concealed from thee the living justice Of which thou mad'st such frequent questioning. 363 \nFor saidst thou: 'Born a man is on the shore Of Indus, and is none who there can speak Of Christ, nor who can read, nor who can write; And all his inclinations and his actions Are good, so far as human reason sees, Without a sin in life or in discourse: He dieth unbaptised and without faith; Where is this justice that condemneth him? Where is his fault, if he do not believe?' Now who art thou, that on the bench wouldst sit In judgment at a thousand miles away, With the short vision of a single span? Truly to him who with me subtilizes, If so the Scripture were not over you, For doubting there were marvellous occasion. O animals terrene, O stolid minds, The primal will, that in itself is good, Ne'er from itself, the Good Supreme, has moved. So much is just as is accordant with it; No good created draws it to itself, But it, by raying forth, occasions that.\" Even as above her nest goes circling round The stork when she has fed her little ones, And he who has been fed looks up at her, So lifted I my brows, and even such Became the blessed image, which its wings Was moving, by so many counsels urged. Circling around it sang, and said: \"As are My notes to thee, who dost not comprehend them, Such is the eternal judgment to you mortals.\" Those lucent splendours of the Holy Spirit Grew quiet then, but still within the standard That made the Romans reverend to the world. It recommenced: \"Unto this kingdom never Ascended one who had not faith in Christ, Before or since he to the tree was nailed. But look thou, many crying are, 'Christ, Christ!' Who at the judgment shall be far less near To him than some shall be who knew not Christ. Such Christians shall the Ethiop condemn, 364 \nWhen the two companies shall be divided, The one for ever rich, the other poor. What to your kings may not the Persians say, When they that volume opened shall behold In which are written down all their dispraises? There shall be seen, among the deeds of Albert, That which ere long shall set the pen in motion, For which the realm of Prague shall be deserted. There shall be seen the woe that on the Seine He brings by falsifying of the coin, Who by the blow of a wild boar shall die. There shall be seen the pride that causes thirst, Which makes the Scot and Englishman so mad That they within their boundaries cannot rest; Be seen the luxury and effeminate life Of him of Spain, and the Bohemian, Who valour never knew and never wished; Be seen the Cripple of Jerusalem, His goodness represented by an I, While the reverse an M shall represent; Be seen the avarice and poltroonery Of him who guards the Island of the Fire, Wherein Anchises finished his long life; And to declare how pitiful he is Shall be his record in contracted letters Which shall make note of much in little space. And shall appear to each one the foul deeds Of uncle and of brother who a nation So famous have dishonoured, and two crowns. And he of Portugal and he of Norway Shall there be known, and he of Rascia too, Who saw in evil hour the coin of Venice. O happy Hungary, if she let herself Be wronged no farther! and Navarre the happy, If with the hills that gird her she be armed! And each one may believe that now, as hansel Thereof, do Nicosia and Famagosta Lament and rage because of their own beast, Who from the others' flank departeth not.\" 365",
      "modern": "The beautiful image appeared before me\nwith its wings spread wide—\n\nIn sweet fulfillment, the interwoven souls\nMade themselves jubilant—each appeared\nA small ruby, burning with refracted sunlight\nThat blazed so bright it filled my eyes with fire.\n\nWhat I must now recount has never been\nReported by any voice, written in any ink,\nOr grasped by human imagination—\nFor I saw the eagle's beak both speak and heard it,\n\nUttering with its voice both \"I\" and \"My\"\nWhen in its essence it was \"We\" and \"Our.\"\nAnd it began: \"Being just and merciful,\nI am exalted here to that glory\n\nWhich cannot be exceeded by desire.\nOn earth I left behind such memory\nThat even wicked people praise it there,\nThough they refuse to follow its example.\"\n\nJust as a single heat rises from many coals,\nSo from countless loves a single voice\nIssued forth from that magnificent image.\nI responded: \"O eternal flowers\n\nOf everlasting joy, you who make me\nPerceive your countless fragrances as one—\nRelease me from the great fast that has held me\nStarving for so long, finding no food on earth.\n\nI know well that Divine Justice makes\nIts perfect mirror in some other realm of heaven,\nWhile yours perceives it without any veil.\nYou know how eagerly I prepare myself\n\nTo listen, and you know the doubt\nThat has been such an ancient hunger in me.\"\nLike a falcon emerging from its hood,\nMoving its head and beating its wings proudly,\n\nShowing desire and preening itself fine—\nSo I saw that standard become, woven\nWith praises of divine grace,\nSinging songs known only to those who rejoice there.\n\nThen it began: \"He who traced the compass\nAround the world's outer edge, and within it\nDesigned so much that remains hidden and revealed,\nCould never so imprint his power\n\nUpon the entire universe that his Word\nWould not remain infinitely beyond it.\nThis proves that the first proud being,\nThe summit of all creation,\n\nFell unripe by refusing to wait for light.\nFrom this it's clear that every lesser nature\nIs too small a vessel for that good\nWhich has no end and measures itself alone.\n\nTherefore our vision—which must be\nSome ray of that intelligence\nThat fills all things—cannot by its nature\nBe powerful enough to avoid seeing\n\nIts origin far beyond what appears to it.\nSo into eternal justice, the power of sight\nYour world receives penetrates like an eye\nInto the ocean—though it sees the bottom\n\nNear shore, it cannot perceive it in the deep,\nYet it is there, hidden by the depths.\nThere is no light except from that serene\nClarity that is never overcast—\n\nAll else is darkness, shadow of the flesh,\nOr its poison. Now the cavern is fully opened\nThat has concealed from you the living justice\nYou have questioned so persistently.\n\nYou asked: 'A man is born on the shore\nOf the Indus, where no one can speak\nOf Christ, or read, or write.\nAll his desires and actions\n\nAre good, as far as human reason sees,\nWithout sin in life or speech.\nHe dies unbaptized and without faith—\nWhere is the justice that condemns him?\n\nWhat is his fault if he does not believe?'\nWho are you to sit in judgment\nA thousand miles away\nWith the short sight of a single span?\n\nTruly, for one who argues subtly with me,\nIf Scripture were not over you as guide,\nThere would be marvelous occasion for doubt.\nO earthbound animals! O dull minds!\n\nThe primal will, good in itself,\nHas never moved away from itself, the Supreme Good.\nOnly what accords with it is just—\nNo created good draws it toward itself,\n\nBut it, by radiating forth, creates that good.\"\nLike a stork circling above her nest\nAfter feeding her young ones,\nWhile the fed chick gazes up at her,\n\nSo I lifted my face, and such\nBecame that blessed image, moving its wings\nDriven by so many counsels.\nWheeling around, it sang: \"As my notes\n\nAre to you, who cannot understand them,\nSo is eternal judgment to mortals.\"\nThose shining splendors of the Holy Spirit\nFell silent then, still within the standard\n\nThat made the Romans revered throughout the world.\nIt continued: \"To this kingdom\nNo one has ever ascended without faith in Christ,\nBefore or after he was nailed to the tree.\n\nBut look—many cry 'Christ!

      "original": "When he who all the world illuminates Out of our hemisphere so far descends That on all sides the daylight is consumed, The heaven, that erst by him alone was kindled, Doth suddenly reveal itself again By many lights, wherein is one resplendent. And came into my mind this act of heaven, When the ensign of the world and of its leaders Had silent in the blessed beak become; Because those living luminaries all, By far more luminous, did songs begin Lapsing and falling from my memory. O gentle Love, that with a smile dost cloak thee, How ardent in those sparks didst thou appear, That had the breath alone of holy thoughts! After the precious and pellucid crystals, With which begemmed the sixth light I beheld, Silence imposed on the angelic bells, I seemed to hear the murmuring of a river That clear descendeth down from rock to rock, Showing the affluence of its mountain-top. And as the sound upon the cithern's neck Taketh its form, and as upon the vent Of rustic pipe the wind that enters it, Even thus, relieved from the delay of waiting, That murmuring of the eagle mounted up Along its neck, as if it had been hollow. There it became a voice, and issued thence From out its beak, in such a form of words 366 As the heart waited for wherein I wrote them. \"The part in me which sees and bears the sun In mortal eagles,\" it began to me, \"Now fixedly must needs be looked upon; For of the fires of which I make my figure, Those whence the eye doth sparkle in my head Of all their orders the supremest are. He who is shining in the midst as pupil Was once the singer of the Holy Spirit, Who bore the ark from city unto city; Now knoweth he the merit of his song, In so far as effect of his own counsel, By the reward which is commensurate. Of five, that make a circle for my brow, He that approacheth nearest to my beak Did the poor widow for her son console; Now knoweth he how dearly it doth cost Not following Christ, by the experience Of this sweet life and of its opposite. He who comes next in the circumference Of which I speak, upon its highest arc, Did death postpone by penitence sincere; Now knoweth he that the eternal judgment Suffers no change, albeit worthy prayer Maketh below to-morrow of to-day. The next who follows, with the laws and me, Under the good intent that bore bad fruit Became a Greek by ceding to the pastor; Now knoweth he how all the ill deduced From his good action is not harmful to him, Although the world thereby may be destroyed. And he, whom in the downward arc thou seest, Guglielmo was, whom the same land deplores That weepeth Charles and Frederick yet alive; Now knoweth he how heaven enamoured is With a just king; and in the outward show Of his effulgence he reveals it still. Who would believe, down in the errant world, That e'er the Trojan Ripheus in this round Could be the fifth one of the holy lights? 367 \nNow knoweth he enough of what the world Has not the power to see of grace divine, Although his sight may not discern the bottom.\" Like as a lark that in the air expatiates, First singing and then silent with content Of the last sweetness that doth satisfy her, Such seemed to me the image of the imprint Of the eternal pleasure, by whose will Doth everything become the thing it is. And notwithstanding to my doubt I was As glass is to the colour that invests it, To wait the time in silence it endured not, But forth from out my mouth, \"What things are these?\" Extorted with the force of its own weight; Whereat I saw great joy of coruscation. Thereafterward with eye still more enkindled The blessed standard made to me reply, To keep me not in wonderment suspended: \"I see that thou believest in these things Because I say them, but thou seest not how; So that, although believed in, they are hidden. Thou doest as he doth who a thing by name Well apprehendeth, but its quiddity Cannot perceive, unless another show it. 'Regnum coelorum' suffereth violence From fervent love, and from that living hope That overcometh the Divine volition; Not in the guise that man o'ercometh man, But conquers it because it will be conquered, And conquered conquers by benignity. The first life of the eyebrow and the fifth Cause thee astonishment, because with them Thou seest the region of the angels painted. They passed not from their bodies, as thou thinkest, Gentiles, but Christians in the steadfast faith Of feet that were to suffer and had suffered. For one from Hell, where no one e'er turns back Unto good will, returned unto his bones, And that of living hope was the reward,— Of living hope, that placed its efficacy 368 \nIn prayers to God made to resuscitate him, So that 'twere possible to move his will. The glorious soul concerning which I speak, Returning to the flesh, where brief its stay, Believed in Him who had the power to aid it; And, in believing, kindled to such fire Of genuine love, that at the second death Worthy it was to come unto this joy. The other one, through grace, that from so deep A fountain wells that never hath the eye Of any creature reached its primal wave, Set all his love below on righteousness; Wherefore from grace to grace did God unclose His eye to our redemption yet to be, Whence he believed therein, and suffered not From that day forth the stench of paganism, And he reproved therefor the folk perverse. Those Maidens three, whom at the right-hand wheel Thou didst behold, were unto him for baptism More than a thousand years before baptizing. O thou predestination, how remote Thy root is from the aspect of all those Who the First Cause do not behold entire! And you, O mortals! hold yourselves restrained In judging; for ourselves, who look on God, We do not know as yet all the elect; And sweet to us is such a deprivation, Because our good in this good is made perfect, That whatsoe'er God wills, we also will.\" After this manner by that shape divine, To make clear in me my short-sightedness, Was given to me a pleasant medicine; And as good singer a good lutanist Accompanies with vibrations of the chords, Whereby more pleasantness the song acquires, So, while it spake, do I remember me That I beheld both of those blessed lights, Even as the winking of the eyes concords, Moving unto the words their little flames. 369",

itself again\nthrough countless lights, with one most radiant.\n\nThis celestial act came into my mind\nwhen the eagle—emblem of the world and its rulers—\nhad fallen silent in its blessed beak.\nAll those living lights of souls\nbecame far more luminous and began songs\nthat now slip and fade from my memory.\n\nO gentle Love, cloaked in smiles,\nhow ardent you appeared in those sparks\nthat

waiting's delay—\nthat murmuring of the eagle rose up\nalong its neck, as if hollow within.\n\nThere it became a voice and issued forth\nfrom its beak in words\nmy heart awaited, and which I now

believe in the wandering world below\nthat Trojan Ripheus could ever be\nthe fifth among these holy lights?\nNow he knows enough of what the world\ncannot see of divine grace,\nthough even his sight

things?\" burst from my mouth\nwith the force of its own weight.\nAt this I saw great flashing joy.\n\nThen with eyes even more kindled,\nthe blessed standard replied,\nnot to leave me suspended in wonder:\n\"I see you believe these things\nbecause I speak them, but cannot see how—\nso though believed, they remain hidden.\n\nYou act like one who grasps a thing by name\nbut cannot perceive its essence\nunless another reveals it.\nThe Kingdom of Heaven suffers violence\nfrom fervent love and living hope\nthat conquers the Divine will—\n\nnot as one person conquers another,\nbut conquers

Because my beauty, that along the stairs Of the eternal palace more enkindles, As thou hast seen, the farther we ascend, If it were tempered not, is so resplendent That all thy mortal power in its effulgence Would seem a leaflet that the thunder crushes. We are uplifted to the seventh splendour, That underneath the burning Lion's breast Now radiates downward mingled with his power. Fix in direction of thine eyes the mind, And make of them a mirror for the figure That in this mirror shall appear to thee.\" He who could know what was the pasturage My sight had in that blessed countenance, When I transferred me to another care, Would recognize how grateful was to me Obedience unto my celestial escort, By counterpoising one side with the other. Within the crystal which, around the world Revolving, bears the name of its dear leader, Under whom every wickedness lay dead, Coloured like gold, on which the sunshine gleams, 370 A stairway I beheld to such a height Uplifted, that mine eye pursued it not. Likewise beheld I down the steps descending So many splendours, that I thought each light That in the heaven appears was there diffused. And as accordant with their natural custom The rooks together at the break of day Bestir themselves to warm their feathers cold; Then some of them fly off without return, Others come back to where they started from, And others, wheeling round, still keep at home; Such fashion it appeared to me was there Within the sparkling that together came, As soon as on a certain step it struck, And that which nearest unto us remained Became so clear, that in my thought I said, \"Well I perceive the love thou showest me; But she, from whom I wait the how and when Of speech and silence, standeth still; whence I Against desire do well if I ask not.\" She thereupon, who saw my silentness In the sight of Him who seeth everything, Said unto me, \"Let loose thy warm desire.\" And I began: \"No merit of my own Renders me worthy of response from thee; But for her sake who granteth me the asking, Thou blessed life that dost remain concealed In thy beatitude, make known to me The cause which draweth thee so near my side; And tell me why is silent in this wheel The dulcet symphony of Paradise, That through the rest below sounds so devoutly.\" \"Thou hast thy hearing mortal as thy sight,\" It answer made to me; \"they sing not here, For the same cause that Beatrice has not smiled. Thus far adown the holy stairway's steps Have I descended but to give thee welcome With words, and with the light that mantles me; Nor did more love cause me to be more ready, For love as much and more up there is burning, 371 \nAs doth the flaming manifest to thee. But the high charity, that makes us servants Prompt to the counsel which controls the world, Allotteth here, even as thou dost observe.\" \"I see full well,\" said I, \"O sacred lamp! How love unfettered in this court sufficeth To follow the eternal Providence; But this is what seems hard for me to see, Wherefore predestinate wast thou alone Unto this office from among thy consorts.\" No sooner had I come to the last word, Than of its middle made the light a centre, Whirling itself about like a swift millstone. When answer made the love that was therein: \"On me directed is a light divine, Piercing through this in which I am embosomed, Of which the virtue with my sight conjoined Lifts me above myself so far, I see The supreme essence from which this is drawn. Hence comes the joyfulness with which I flame, For to my sight, as far as it is clear, The clearness of the flame I equal make. But that soul in the heaven which is most pure, That seraph which his eye on God most fixes, Could this demand of thine not satisfy; Because so deeply sinks in the abyss Of the eternal statute what thou askest, From all created sight it is cut off. And to the mortal world, when thou returnest, This carry back, that it may not presume Longer tow'rd such a goal to move its feet. The mind, that shineth here, on earth doth smoke; From this observe how can it do below That which it cannot though the heaven assume it?\" Such limit did its words prescribe to me, The question I relinquished, and restricted Myself to ask it humbly who it was. \"Between two shores of Italy rise cliffs, And not far distant from thy native place, So high, the thunders far below them sound, 372 \nAnd form a ridge that Catria is called, 'Neath which is consecrate a hermitage Wont to be dedicate to worship only.\" Thus unto me the third speech recommenced, And then, continuing, it said: \"Therein Unto God's service I became so steadfast, That feeding only on the juice of olives Lightly I passed away the heats and frosts, Contented in my thoughts contemplative. That cloister used to render to these heavens Abundantly, and now is empty grown, So that perforce it soon must be revealed. I in that place was Peter Damiano; And Peter the Sinner was I in the house Of Our Lady on the Adriatic shore. Little of mortal life remained to me, When I was called and dragged forth to the hat Which shifteth evermore from bad to worse. Came Cephas, and the mighty Vessel came Of the Holy Spirit, meagre and barefooted, Taking the food of any hostelry. Now some one to support them on each side The modern shepherds need, and some to lead them, So heavy are they, and to hold their trains. They cover up their palfreys with their cloaks, So that two beasts go underneath one skin; O Patience, that dost tolerate so much!\" At this voice saw I many little flames From step to step descending and revolving, And every revolution made them fairer. Round about this one came they and stood still, And a cry uttered of so loud a sound, It here could find no parallel, nor I Distinguished it, the thunder so o'ercame me. 373",

what pasture\nmy sight found in that blessed face,\nwhen I turned to another care,\nwould understand how grateful I was\nfor obedience to my celestial guide,\nweighing one joy against the other.\n\nWithin the crystal sphere that revolves\naround the world and bears the name\nof its dear leader, under whom\nall wickedness lay dead,\nI saw a stairway rising to such heights,\ncolored like gold struck by sunlight,\nthat my eyes could not follow it.\n\nI also saw descending down the steps\nso many splendors that I thought\nevery light that appears in heaven\nhad been scattered there.\n\nAs rooks gather together at daybreak\naccording to their natural custom,\nstirring themselves to warm their cold feathers—\nsome flying away never to return,\nothers circling back to where they started,\nand still others wheeling around their home—\nsuch was the pattern I saw there\nwithin the sparkling lights that came together\nas soon as they struck a certain step.\n\nThe one that remained nearest to us\nbecame so bright that in my mind I said,\n\"I clearly see the love you show me.\nBut she from whom I await the how and when\nof speech and silence stands still,\nso I do well to ask nothing, despite my desire.\"\n\nThen she, who saw my silence\nin the sight of Him who sees everything,\nsaid to me, \"Release your burning desire.\"\n\nAnd I began: \"No merit of my own\nmakes me worthy of your response,\nbut for her sake who grants me this asking,\nblessed life that remains hidden\nin your beatitude, reveal to me\nthe cause that draws you so near my side.\n\nTell me why the sweet symphony of Paradise,\nwhich sounds so devoutly through the spheres below,\nis silent in this wheel.\"\n\n\"Your hearing is mortal, like your sight,\"\ncame the answer. \"They do not sing here\nfor the same reason that Beatrice has not smiled.\n\nI have descended this far down\nthe holy stairway's steps only to welcome you\nwith words and with the light that cloaks me.\nGreater love did not make me more ready—\nlove burns as much and more up there,\nas the flaming makes clear to you.\n\nBut the high charity that makes us servants,\nprompt to the counsel that governs the world,\nassigns us here, as you observe.\"\n\n\"I see clearly, sacred lamp,\nhow unfettered love in this court\nis enough to follow eternal Providence.\nBut this seems difficult for me to understand:\nwhy were you alone predestined\nto this office among your companions?\"\n\nNo sooner had I reached the final word\nthan the light made its center a spinning point,\nwhirling like a swift millstone.\n\nThen the love within it answered:\n\"A divine light is directed upon me,\npiercing through this radiance that embraces me.\nIts power, joined with my sight,\nlifts me so far above myself\nthat I see the supreme essence from which it flows.\n\nFrom this comes the joy with which I flame—\nI match the brightness of my fire\nto the clarity of my vision.\n\nBut that soul in heaven which is most pure,\nthat seraph who fixes his gaze most intently on God,\ncould not satisfy this question of yours.\nWhat you ask sinks so deeply\ninto the abyss of eternal decree\nthat it is cut off

was.\n\n\"Between Italy's two shores rise cliffs\nnot far from your native place,\nso high that thunder sounds far below them.\nThey form a ridge called Catria,\nbeneath which stands consecrated a

      "original": "Oppressed with stupor, I unto my guide Turned like a little child who always runs For refuge there where he confideth most; And she, even as a mother who straightway Gives comfort to her pale and breathless boy With voice whose wont it is to reassure him, Said to me: \"Knowest thou not thou art in heaven, And knowest thou not that heaven is holy all And what is done here cometh from good zeal? After what wise the singing would have changed thee And I by smiling, thou canst now imagine, Since that the cry has startled thee so much, In which if thou hadst understood its prayers Already would be known to thee the vengeance Which thou shalt look upon before thou diest. The sword above here smiteth not in haste Nor tardily, howe'er it seem to him Who fearing or desiring waits for it. But turn thee round towards the others now, For very illustrious spirits shalt thou see, If thou thy sight directest as I say.\" As it seemed good to her mine eyes I turned, And saw a hundred spherules that together With mutual rays each other more embellished. I stood as one who in himself represses The point of his desire, and ventures not To question, he so feareth the too much. And now the largest and most luculent Among those pearls came forward, that it might 374 Make my desire concerning it content. Within it then I heard: \"If thou couldst see Even as myself the charity that burns Among us, thy conceits would be expressed; But, that by waiting thou mayst not come late To the high end, I will make answer even Unto the thought of which thou art so chary. That mountain on whose slope Cassino stands Was frequented of old upon its summit By a deluded folk and ill-disposed; And I am he who first up thither bore The name of Him who brought upon the earth The truth that so much sublimateth us. And such abundant grace upon me shone That all the neighbouring towns I drew away From the impious worship that seduced the world. These other fires, each one of them, were men Contemplative, enkindled by that heat Which maketh holy flowers and fruits spring up. Here is Macarius, here is Romualdus, Here are my brethren, who within the cloisters Their footsteps stayed and kept a steadfast heart.\" And I to him: \"The affection which thou showest Speaking with me, and the good countenance Which I behold and note in all your ardours, In me have so my confidence dilated As the sun doth the rose, when it becomes As far unfolded as it hath the power. Therefore I pray, and thou assure me, father, If I may so much grace receive, that I May thee behold with countenance unveiled.\" He thereupon: \"Brother, thy high desire In the remotest sphere shall be fulfilled, Where are fulfilled all others and my own. There perfect is, and ripened, and complete, Every desire; within that one alone Is every part where it has always been; For it is not in space, nor turns on poles, And unto it our stairway reaches up, Whence thus from out thy sight it steals away. 375 \nUp to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it Extending its supernal part, what time So thronged with angels it appeared to him. But to ascend it now no one uplifts His feet from off the earth, and now my Rule Below remaineth for mere waste of paper. The walls that used of old to be an Abbey Are changed to dens of robbers, and the cowls Are sacks filled full of miserable flour. But heavy usury is not taken up So much against God's pleasure as that fruit Which maketh so insane the heart of monks; For whatsoever hath the Church in keeping Is for the folk that ask it in God's name, Not for one's kindred or for something worse. The flesh of mortals is so very soft, That good beginnings down below suffice not From springing of the oak to bearing acorns. Peter began with neither gold nor silver, And I with orison and abstinence, And Francis with humility his convent. And if thou lookest at each one's beginning, And then regardest whither he has run, Thou shalt behold the white changed into brown. In verity the Jordan backward turned, And the sea's fleeing, when God willed were more A wonder to behold, than succour here.\" Thus unto me he said; and then withdrew To his own band, and the band closed together; Then like a whirlwind all was upward rapt. The gentle Lady urged me on behind them Up o'er that stairway by a single sign, So did her virtue overcome my nature; Nor here below, where one goes up and down By natural law, was motion e'er so swift That it could be compared unto my wing. Reader, as I may unto that devout Triumph return, on whose account I often For my transgressions weep and beat my breast,— Thou hadst not thrust thy finger in the fire 376 \nAnd drawn it out again, before I saw The sign that follows Taurus, and was in it. O glorious stars, O light impregnated With mighty virtue, from which I acknowledge All of my genius, whatsoe'er it be, With you was born, and hid himself with you, He who is father of all mortal life, When first I tasted of the Tuscan air; And then when grace was freely given to me To enter the high wheel which turns you round, Your region was allotted unto me. To you devoutly at this hour my soul Is sighing, that it virtue may acquire For the stern pass that draws it to itself. \"Thou art so near unto the last salvation,\" Thus Beatrice began, \"thou oughtest now To have thine eves unclouded and acute; And therefore, ere thou enter farther in, Look down once more, and see how vast a world Thou hast already put beneath thy feet; So that thy heart, as jocund as it may, Present itself to the triumphant throng That comes rejoicing through this rounded ether.\" I with my sight returned through one and all The sevenfold spheres, and I beheld this globe Such that I smiled at its ignoble semblance; And that opinion I approve as best Which doth account it least; and he who thinks Of something else may truly be called just. I saw the daughter of Latona shining Without that shadow, which to me was cause That once I had believed her rare and dense. The aspect of thy son, Hyperion, Here I sustained, and saw how move themselves Around and near him Maia and Dione. Thence there appeared the temperateness of Jove 'Twixt son and father, and to me was clear The change that of their whereabout they make; And all the seven made manifest to me How great they are, and eke how swift they are, 377 \nAnd how they are in distant habitations. The threshing-floor that maketh us so proud, To me revolving with the eternal Twins, Was all apparent made from hill to harbour! Then to the beauteous eyes mine eyes I turned. 378",
      "modern": "Overwhelmed with wonder, I turned to my guide\nlike a small child who always runs\nfor comfort\n\nThere where he trusts the most; and she, like a mother\nwho instantly comforts her pale and breathless child\nwith a voice that always soothes him,\nsaid to me: \"Don't you know you are in heaven?\nDon't you know that all of heaven is holy\nand everything done here springs from righteous zeal?\n\nYou can now imagine how the singing would have transformed you,\nand how my smile would have affected you,\nsince that cry startled you so much—\na cry whose prayers, if you had understood them,\nwould have already revealed to you the vengeance\nyou will witness before you die.\n\nThe sword of justice here strikes neither hastily nor late,\nhowever it may seem to one\nwho waits for it in fear or desire.\nBut turn now toward the others,\nfor you will see most illustrious spirits\nif you direct your gaze as I tell you.\"\n\nAs seemed good to her, I turned my eyes\nand saw a hundred small spheres that together\nmade each other more beautiful with their mingled light.\nI stood like one who holds back\nthe urgency of his desire, not daring\nto ask questions, so afraid of going too far.\n\nAnd the largest and most radiant\namong those pearls came forward\nto satisfy my curiosity about it.\nThen from within it I heard: \"If you could see,\nas I do, the love that burns\namong us, your thoughts would be spoken;\n\nbut so that waiting won't delay you\nfrom reaching the highest goal, I will answer\neven the thought you're so reluctant to voice.\nThat mountain on whose slope Cassino stands\nwas once frequented on its summit\nby a deluded and misguided people;\n\nand I am he who first carried up there\nthe name of Him who brought to earth\nthe truth that lifts us so high.\nSuch abundant grace shone upon me\nthat I drew all the neighboring towns away\nfrom the impious worship that seduced the world.\n\nThese other flames were all contemplative men,\nkindled by that heat\nwhich makes holy flowers and fruits spring forth.\nHere is Macarius, here is Romualdus,\nhere are my brothers who within the cloisters\nkept their steps steady and their hearts constant.\"\n\nAnd I replied: \"The affection you show\nin speaking with me, and the kindness\nI see and recognize in all your ardor,\nhave expanded my confidence\nlike the sun does the rose when it unfolds\nas fully as it has the power to do.\n\nTherefore I beg you, and you must assure me, father,\nif I can receive grace enough\nto see you with your face unveiled.\"\n\nThen he: \"Brother, your lofty desire\nwill be fulfilled in the highest sphere,\nwhere all desires are fulfilled, both others' and my own.\nThere every longing is perfect, mature, and complete;\nin that sphere alone\nevery part exists where it has always been,\n\nfor it is not in space, nor turns on axes,\nand our ladder reaches up to it,\nwhich is why it steals away from your sight.\nUp to that height the Patriarch Jacob saw it\nextending its celestial portion,\nwhen it appeared to him so crowded with angels.\n\nBut now no one lifts\nhis feet from earth to climb it, and my Rule\nbelow remains mere waste of paper.\nThe walls that once were an abbey\nhave become dens of thieves, and the cowls\nare sacks full of rotten flour.\n\nBut even heavy usury is not taken up\nso much against God's pleasure as that fruit\nwhich drives the hearts of monks insane;\nfor whatever the Church holds in trust\nbelongs to those who ask for it in God's name,\nnot to one's family or something worse.\n\nThe flesh of mortals is so weak\nthat good beginnings down below don't last\nfrom the oak's sprouting to its bearing acorns.\nPeter began with neither gold nor silver,\nI with prayer and fasting,\nand Francis founded his order with humility.\n\nAnd if you look at each one's beginning\nand then see where he has wandered,\nyou'll see the white has turned to brown.\nTruly the Jordan flowing backward\nand the sea's parting, when God willed it, were less\nmiraculous to witness than help here would be.\"\n\nSo he spoke to me; then withdrew\nto his company, and the company closed together;\nthen like a whirlwind all were swept upward.\nThe gentle Lady urged me up behind them\nover that stairway with a single gesture,\nso completely did her power overcome my nature;\n\nnor here below, where we go up and down\nby natural law, was motion ever so swift\nthat it could compare to my flight.\nReader, so may I return to that devout\ntriumph for which I often weep\nand beat my breast for my sins—\n\nyou could not have thrust your finger in fire\nand pulled it out again as quickly as I saw\nthe sign that follows Taurus and found myself within it.\nO glorious stars, O light pregnant\nwith mighty power, from which I acknowledge\nall my genius, whatever it may be!\n\nWith you was born and hid himself with you\nhe who is father of all mortal life,\nwhen I first breathed the Tuscan air;\nand then when grace was freely granted me\nto enter the great wheel that turns you round,\nyour region was assigned to me.\n\nTo you my soul devoutly sighs\nat this moment, that it may gain strength\nfor the difficult passage that draws it onward.\n\"You are so close to final salvation,\"\nBeatrice began, \"that you should now\nhave your eyes clear and sharp;\n\nand therefore, before you go farther in,\nlook down once more and see how vast a world\nyou have already placed beneath your feet,\nso that your heart, as joyful as it can be,\nmay present itself to the triumphant throng\nthat comes rejoicing through this rounded sky.\"\n\nWith my sight I traveled back through each\nof the seven spheres, and I saw this globe\nso small that I smiled at its humble appearance;\nand I approve that judgment as best\nwhich considers it least;

But brief the space from one When to the other; Of my awaiting, say I, and the seeing The welkin grow resplendent more and more. And Beatrice exclaimed: \"Behold the hosts Of Christ's triumphal march, and all the fruit Harvested by the rolling of these spheres!\" It seemed to me her face was all aflame; And eyes she had so full of ecstasy That I must needs pass on without describing. As when in nights serene of the full moon Smiles Trivia among the nymphs eternal Who paint the firmament through all its gulfs, Saw I, above the myriads of lamps, A Sun that one and all of them enkindled, 379 E'en as our own doth the supernal sights, And through the living light transparent shone The lucent substance so intensely clear Into my sight, that I sustained it not. O Beatrice, thou gentle guide and dear! To me she said: \"What overmasters thee A virtue is from which naught shields itself. There are the wisdom and the omnipotence That oped the thoroughfares 'twixt heaven and earth, For which there erst had been so long a yearning.\" As fire from out a cloud unlocks itself, Dilating so it finds not room therein, And down, against its nature, falls to earth, So did my mind, among those aliments Becoming larger, issue from itself, And that which it became cannot remember. \"Open thine eyes, and look at what I am: Thou hast beheld such things, that strong enough Hast thou become to tolerate my smile.\" I was as one who still retains the feeling Of a forgotten vision, and endeavours In vain to bring it back into his mind, When I this invitation heard, deserving Of so much gratitude, it never fades Out of the book that chronicles the past. If at this moment sounded all the tongues That Polyhymnia and her sisters made Most lubrical with their delicious milk, To aid me, to a thousandth of the truth It would not reach, singing the holy smile And how the holy aspect it illumed. And therefore, representing Paradise, The sacred poem must perforce leap over, Even as a man who finds his way cut off; But whoso thinketh of the ponderous theme, And of the mortal shoulder laden with it, Should blame it not, if under this it tremble. It is no passage for a little boat This which goes cleaving the audacious prow, Nor for a pilot who would spare himself. 380 \n\"Why doth my face so much enamour thee, That to the garden fair thou turnest not, Which under the rays of Christ is blossoming? There is the Rose in which the Word Divine Became incarnate; there the lilies are By whose perfume the good way was discovered.\" Thus Beatrice; and I, who to her counsels Was wholly ready, once again betook me Unto the battle of the feeble brows. As in the sunshine, that unsullied streams Through fractured cloud, ere now a meadow of flowers Mine eyes with shadow covered o'er have seen, So troops of splendours manifold I saw Illumined from above with burning rays, Beholding not the source of the effulgence. O power benignant that dost so imprint them! Thou didst exalt thyself to give more scope There to mine eyes, that were not strong enough. The name of that fair flower I e'er invoke Morning and evening utterly enthralled My soul to gaze upon the greater fire. And when in both mine eyes depicted were The glory and greatness of the living star Which there excelleth, as it here excelled, Athwart the heavens a little torch descended Formed in a circle like a coronal, And cinctured it, and whirled itself about it. Whatever melody most sweetly soundeth On earth, and to itself most draws the soul, Would seem a cloud that, rent asunder, thunders, Compared unto the sounding of that lyre Wherewith was crowned the sapphire beautiful, Which gives the clearest heaven its sapphire hue. \"I am Angelic Love, that circle round The joy sublime which breathes from out the womb That was the hostelry of our Desire; And I shall circle, Lady of Heaven, while Thou followest thy Son, and mak'st diviner The sphere supreme, because thou enterest there.\" Thus did the circulated melody 381 \nSeal itself up; and all the other lights Were making to resound the name of Mary. The regal mantle of the volumes all Of that world, which most fervid is and living With breath of God and with his works and ways, Extended over us its inner border, So very distant, that the semblance of it There where I was not yet appeared to me. Therefore mine eyes did not possess the power Of following the incoronated flame, Which mounted upward near to its own seed. And as a little child, that towards its mother Stretches its arms, when it the milk has taken, Through impulse kindled into outward flame, Each of those gleams of whiteness upward reached So with its summit, that the deep affection They had for Mary was revealed to me. Thereafter they remained there in my sight, 'Regina coeli' singing with such sweetness, That ne'er from me has the delight departed. O, what exuberance is garnered up Within those richest coffers, which had been Good husbandmen for sowing here below! There they enjoy and live upon the treasure Which was acquired while weeping in the exile Of Babylon, wherein the gold was left. There triumpheth, beneath the exalted Son Of God and Mary, in his victory, Both with the ancient council and the new, He who doth keep the keys of such a glory. 382",

stood, erect and watchful,\nturned toward that zone beneath which\nthe sun displays its slower course.\nSeeing her so rapt and yearning,\nI became like one who desires something,\nyearning and hoping to be satisfied.\n\nBut brief was the time between\nmy waiting and my seeing\nthe heavens grow more radiant.\nAnd Beatrice cried out: \"Behold\nthe hosts of Christ's triumph,\nall the fruit gathered by these turning spheres!\"\n\nHer face seemed all aflame to me,\nher eyes so full of ecstasy\nthat I must pass on without describing them.\nAs when in clear nights of the full moon\nTrivia smiles among eternal nymphs\nwho paint the sky through all its depths,\nI saw above countless lamps\na Sun that kindled every one,\njust as our sun lights the stars above.\n\nThrough that living light there shone\na substance so intensely bright,\nso clear into my sight,\nthat I could not endure it.\n\n\"O Beatrice, gentle and dear guide!\"\nShe said to me: \"What overwhelms you\nis a power from which nothing shields itself.\nHere are the wisdom and the might\nthat opened pathways between heaven and earth,\nfor which there had been such long yearning.\"\n\nLike fire bursting from a cloud,\nexpanding till it finds no room within,\nand falls to earth against its nature,\nso my mind, growing large among those feasts,\nissued from itself,\nand what it became I cannot remember.\n\n\"Open your eyes and see what I am:\nyou have witnessed such things\nthat you are strong enough now\nto bear my smile.\"\n\nI was like one who still feels\nthe trace of a forgotten vision,\nstriving in vain to bring it back,\nwhen I heard this invitation—\nso worthy of gratitude\nthat it never fades from memory's book.\n\nIf all the tongues that Polyhymnia\nand her sisters made most eloquent\nwith their sweet milk sounded now\nto help me, they would not reach\na thousandth of the truth\nin singing of that holy smile\nand how it lit her sacred face.\n\nTherefore this sacred poem must leap over,\nrepresenting Paradise\nlike a man who finds his way blocked.\nBut whoever thinks of the weighty theme\nand mortal shoulder bearing it\nshould not blame if it trembles beneath.\nThis passage is not for a small boat\ncleaving with bold prow,\nnor for a pilot who would spare himself.\n\n\"Why does my face so enchant you\nthat you do not turn to the fair garden\nthat blossoms under Christ's rays?\nThere is the Rose in which\nthe Divine Word became flesh;\nthere are the lilies by whose fragrance\nthe good path was found.\"\n\nSo Beatrice spoke, and I,\nwholly ready for her counsel,\ncommitted myself again\nto the battle of my weak sight.\n\nAs sunlight streaming pure\nthrough broken cloud has shown me\nmeadows of flowers covered in shadow,\nso I saw manifold troops of splendor\nlit from above by burning rays,\nyet could not see the source of light.\n\nO benevolent power that marks them so!\nYou lifted yourself to give more scope\nto my eyes that were not strong enough.\nThe name of that fair flower\nI invoke morning and evening\nutterly enthralled my soul\nto gaze upon the greater fire.\n\nWhen both my eyes held the image\nof the glory and greatness\nof the living star that excels there\nas it excelled here below,\na little torch descended through the heavens,\nformed in a circle like a crown,\nand girdled it and whirled about it.\n\nWhatever melody sounds sweetest on earth\nand most draws the soul to itself\nwould seem like thundering cloud\ncompared to the sounding of that lyre\nwhich crowned the beautiful sapphire\nthat gives the brightest heaven its blue.\n\n\"I am Angelic Love that circles round\nthe sublime joy breathing from the womb\nthat was the dwelling of our Desire.\nAnd I shall circle, Lady of Heaven,\nwhile you follow your Son\nand make the highest sphere more divine\nbecause you enter there.\"\n\nThus that circling melody\nsealed itself, and all other lights\nresounded with the name of Mary.\nThe royal mantle of all the spheres\nof that world most fervent and alive\nwith God's breath and works and ways\nextended over us its inner border,\nso distant that its appearance\ndid not yet reach where I stood.\n\nTherefore my eyes had no power\nto follow the crowned flame\nthat rose toward its own source.\nAnd like a little child that stretches\nits arms toward its mother\nafter it has taken milk,\nthrough love kindled into outward flame,\neach of those white gleams reached upward\nwith its peak, so that their deep love\nfor Mary was revealed to me.\n\nThen they remained there in my sight,\nsinging \"Regina coeli\" with such sweetness\nthat the delight has never left me.\nO what abundance is stored up\nin those richest treasuries\nthat were good farmers for sowing below!\nThere they rejoice and live upon the treasure\nacquired while weeping in the exile\nof Babylon, where the gold was abandoned.\n\nThere triumphs, beneath the exalted Son\nof God and Mary, in his

And as the wheels in works of horologes Revolve so that the first to the beholder Motionless seems, and the last one to fly, So in like manner did those carols, dancing In different measure, of their affluence Give me the gauge, as they were swift or slow. From that one which I noted of most beauty Beheld I issue forth a fire so happy That none it left there of a greater brightness; And around Beatrice three several times It whirled itself with so divine a song, My fantasy repeats it not to me; Therefore the pen skips, and I write it not, Since our imagination for such folds, Much more our speech, is of a tint too glaring. \"O holy sister mine, who us implorest With such devotion, by thine ardent love Thou dost unbind me from that beautiful sphere!\" 383 Thereafter, having stopped, the blessed fire Unto my Lady did direct its breath, Which spake in fashion as I here have said. And she: \"O light eterne of the great man To whom our Lord delivered up the keys He carried down of this miraculous joy, This one examine on points light and grave, As good beseemeth thee, about the Faith By means of which thou on the sea didst walk. If he love well, and hope well, and believe, From thee 'tis hid not; for thou hast thy sight There where depicted everything is seen. But since this kingdom has made citizens By means of the true Faith, to glorify it 'Tis well he have the chance to speak thereof.\" As baccalaureate arms himself, and speaks not Until the master doth propose the question, To argue it, and not to terminate it, So did I arm myself with every reason, While she was speaking, that I might be ready For such a questioner and such profession. \"Say, thou good Christian; manifest thyself; What is the Faith?\" Whereat I raised my brow Unto that light wherefrom was this breathed forth. Then turned I round to Beatrice, and she Prompt signals made to me that I should pour The water forth from my internal fountain. \"May grace, that suffers me to make confession,\" Began I, \"to the great centurion, Cause my conceptions all to be explicit!\" And I continued: \"As the truthful pen, Father, of thy dear brother wrote of it, Who put with thee Rome into the good way, Faith is the substance of the things we hope for, And evidence of those that are not seen; And this appears to me its quiddity.\" Then heard I: \"Very rightly thou perceivest, If well thou understandest why he placed it With substances and then with evidences.\" And I thereafterward: \"The things profound, 384 \nThat here vouchsafe to me their apparition, Unto all eyes below are so concealed, That they exist there only in belief, Upon the which is founded the high hope, And hence it takes the nature of a substance. And it behoveth us from this belief To reason without having other sight, And hence it has the nature of evidence.\" Then heard I: \"If whatever is acquired Below by doctrine were thus understood, No sophist's subtlety would there find place.\" Thus was breathed forth from that enkindled love; Then added: \"Very well has been gone over Already of this coin the alloy and weight; But tell me if thou hast it in thy purse?\" And I: \"Yes, both so shining and so round That in its stamp there is no peradventure.\" Thereafter issued from the light profound That there resplendent was: \"This precious jewel, Upon the which is every virtue founded, Whence hadst thou it?\" And I: \"The large outpouring Of Holy Spirit, which has been diffused Upon the ancient parchments and the new, A syllogism is, which proved it to me With such acuteness, that, compared therewith, All demonstration seems to me obtuse.\" And then I heard: \"The ancient and the new Postulates, that to thee are so conclusive, Why dost thou take them for the word divine?\" And I: \"The proofs, which show the truth to me, Are the works subsequent, whereunto Nature Ne'er heated iron yet, nor anvil beat.\" 'Twas answered me: \"Say, who assureth thee That those works ever were? the thing itself That must be proved, nought else to thee affirms it.\" \"Were the world to Christianity converted,\" I said, \"withouten miracles, this one Is such, the rest are not its hundredth part; Because that poor and fasting thou didst enter Into the field to sow there the good plant, 385 \nWhich was a vine and has become a thorn!\" This being finished, the high, holy Court Resounded through the spheres, \"One God we praise!\" In melody that there above is chanted. And then that Baron, who from branch to branch, Examining, had thus conducted me, Till the extremest leaves we were approaching, Again began: \"The Grace that dallying Plays with thine intellect thy mouth has opened, Up to this point, as it should opened be, So that I do approve what forth emerged; But now thou must express what thou believest, And whence to thy belief it was presented.\" \"O holy father, spirit who beholdest What thou believedst so that thou o'ercamest, Towards the sepulchre, more youthful feet,\" Began I, \"thou dost wish me in this place The form to manifest of my prompt belief, And likewise thou the cause thereof demandest. And I respond: In one God I believe, Sole and eterne, who moveth all the heavens With love and with desire, himself unmoved; And of such faith not only have I proofs Physical and metaphysical, but gives them Likewise the truth that from this place rains down Through Moses, through the Prophets and the Psalms, Through the Evangel, and through you, who wrote After the fiery Spirit sanctified you; In Persons three eterne believe, and these One essence I believe, so one and trine They bear conjunction both with 'sunt' and 'est.' With the profound condition and divine Which now I touch upon, doth stamp my mind Ofttimes the doctrine evangelical. This the beginning is, this is the spark Which afterwards dilates to vivid flame, And, like a star in heaven, is sparkling in me.\" Even as a lord who hears what pleaseth him His servant straight embraces, gratulating For the good news as soon as he is silent; 386 \nSo, giving me its benediction, singing, Three times encircled me, when I was silent, The apostolic light, at whose command I spoken had, in speaking I so pleased him. 387",

fountain\nthat is the source of all his thoughts.\n\nSo spoke Beatrice, and those blessed souls\ntransformed themselves into spinning spheres\nblazing intensely like comets in flight.\n\nLike the wheels inside a clockwork,\nwhere the innermost appears motionless\nto the observer while the outermost flies—\nso these dancing circles moved,\neach at its own rhythm, showing me\nthe measure of

sister, who calls to us\nwith such devotion and burning love,\nyour passion frees me from that glorious sphere!\"\n\nAfter it stopped, the blessed fire\ndirected its voice to my Lady,\nspeaking just

sacred profession.\n\n\"Speak, good Christian, reveal yourself:\nWhat is Faith?\"\n\nAt these words breathed forth from that light\nI raised my face toward its radiance,\nthen turned to Beatrice, who gave me\nswift signals to pour out the water\nfrom my inner fountain.\n\n\"May the grace that allows me to confess\nbefore this great captain,\" I began,\n\"make all my thoughts perfectly clear!\"\n\nAnd I continued: \"Father, as the truthful pen\nof your dear brother wrote—\nhe who with you set Rome on the right path—\n\nFaith is the substance of what we hope for\nand the evidence of things unseen.\nThis seems to me its essential nature.\"\n\nThen I heard: \"You understand correctly,\nif you grasp why he placed Faith\namong substances and then among evidences.\"\n\nAnd I replied: \"The profound realities\nthat reveal themselves to me here\nare so hidden from all eyes below\nthat they exist there only in belief,\non which our highest hope is founded—\nand so Faith takes the nature of substance.\n\nFrom this belief we must reason\nwithout any other sight,\nand so Faith has the nature of evidence.\"\n\nThen I heard: \"If everything learned\nin the world below through teaching\nwere understood this way,\nno clever sophistry would find a place.\"\n\nThis was breathed forth from that burning love,\nwhich then added: \"The composition and weight\nof this coin have been thoroughly examined—\nbut tell me, do you have it in your purse?\"\n\n\"Yes,\" I said, \"so bright and perfectly round\nthat I have no doubt about its stamp.\"\n\nThen from that profound light\nshining there came: \"This precious jewel\non which every virtue is founded—\nwhere did you get it?\"\n\n\"The great outpouring of the Holy Spirit,\"\nI answered, \"spread across both\nthe ancient and new scriptures,\nforms a perfect logical proof\nthat convinced me with such sharpness\nthat all other demonstrations seem dull.\"\n\nThen I heard: \"These old and new authorities\nthat you find so convincing—\nwhy do you accept them as God's word?\"\n\n\"The proof that shows me their truth,\"\nI said, \"lies in the works that followed,\nfor which Nature never heated iron\nor struck her anvil.\"\n\nThe answer came: \"Tell me, who assures you\nthat those works ever happened?\nOnly the thing that needs proving\ntestifies to itself.\"\n\n\"If the world had converted to Christianity\nwithout miracles,\" I replied,\n\"that alone would be such a miracle\nthat the others wouldn't be a hundredth part—\n\nbecause you entered the field poor and fasting\nto plant the good seed\nthat was once a vine\nbut has become a thornbush.\"\n\nWhen this was finished, the high holy court\nrang throughout all the spheres\nwith \"We praise you, one God!\"\nin the melody that is sung above.\n\nThen that Baron who had led me,\nexamining me from branch to branch\nuntil we approached the furthest leaves,\nbegan again:\n\n\"The Grace that converses\nwith your mind has opened your mouth\nproperly up to this point,\nso I approve what has emerged.\n\nBut now you must declare what you believe\nand how this belief came to you.\"\n\n\"O holy father, spirit who can see\nwhat you believed so completely\nthat you outran younger feet\nto the tomb,\" I began,\n\n\"you want me to reveal here\nthe nature of my eager faith\nand also ask the reason for it.\n\nI answer: I believe in

down\nfrom this place through Moses,\nthe Prophets, and the Psalms,\nthrough the Gospel and through you\nwho wrote after the fiery Spirit\nmade you holy.\n\nI believe in three eternal Persons,\nand I

Gospel teaching.\n\nThis is the beginning, this the spark\nthat then expands into living flame\nand sparkles in me like a star in heaven.\"\n\nLike a master who hears welcome news\nand immediately

Thereafterward towards us moved a light Out of that band whence issued the first-fruits Which of his vicars Christ behind him left, And then my Lady, full of ecstasy, Said unto me: \"Look, look! behold the Baron For whom below Galicia is frequented.\" In the same way as, when a dove alights Near his companion, both of them pour forth, Circling about and murmuring, their affection, So one beheld I by the other grand Prince glorified to be with welcome greeted, Lauding the food that there above is eaten. But when their gratulations were complete, Silently 'coram me' each one stood still, So incandescent it o'ercame my sight. Smiling thereafterwards, said Beatrice: \"Illustrious life, by whom the benefactions 388 Of our Basilica have been described, Make Hope resound within this altitude; Thou knowest as oft thou dost personify it As Jesus to the three gave greater clearness.\"— \"Lift up thy head, and make thyself assured; For what comes hither from the mortal world Must needs be ripened in our radiance.\" This comfort came to me from the second fire; Wherefore mine eyes I lifted to the hills, Which bent them down before with too great weight. \"Since, through his grace, our Emperor wills that thou Shouldst find thee face to face, before thy death, In the most secret chamber, with his Counts, So that, the truth beholden of this court, Hope, which below there rightfully enamours, Thereby thou strengthen in thyself and others, Say what it is, and how is flowering with it Thy mind, and say from whence it came to thee.\" Thus did the second light again continue. And the Compassionate, who piloted The plumage of my wings in such high flight, Did in reply anticipate me thus: \"No child whatever the Church Militant Of greater hope possesses, as is written In that Sun which irradiates all our band; Therefore it is conceded him from Egypt To come into Jerusalem to see, Or ever yet his warfare be completed. The two remaining points, that not for knowledge Have been demanded, but that he report How much this virtue unto thee is pleasing, To him I leave; for hard he will not find them, Nor of self-praise; and let him answer them; And may the grace of God in this assist him!\" As a disciple, who his teacher follows, Ready and willing, where he is expert, That his proficiency may be displayed, \"Hope,\" said I, \"is the certain expectation Of future glory, which is the effect Of grace divine and merit precedent. 389 \nFrom many stars this light comes unto me; But he instilled it first into my heart Who was chief singer unto the chief captain. 'Sperent in te,' in the high Theody He sayeth, 'those who know thy name;' and who Knoweth it not, if he my faith possess? Thou didst instil me, then, with his instilling In the Epistle, so that I am full, And upon others rain again your rain.\" While I was speaking, in the living bosom Of that combustion quivered an effulgence, Sudden and frequent, in the guise of lightning; Then breathed: \"The love wherewith I am inflamed Towards the virtue still which followed me Unto the palm and issue of the field, Wills that I breathe to thee that thou delight In her; and grateful to me is thy telling Whatever things Hope promises to thee.\" And I: \"The ancient Scriptures and the new The mark establish, and this shows it me, Of all the souls whom God hath made his friends. Isaiah saith, that each one garmented In his own land shall be with twofold garments, And his own land is this delightful life. Thy brother, too, far more explicitly, There where he treateth of the robes of white, This revelation manifests to us.\" And first, and near the ending of these words, \"Sperent in te\" from over us was heard, To which responsive answered all the carols. Thereafterward a light among them brightened, So that, if Cancer one such crystal had, Winter would have a month of one sole day. And as uprises, goes, and enters the dance A winsome maiden, only to do honour To the new bride, and not from any failing, Even thus did I behold the brightened splendour Approach the two, who in a wheel revolved As was beseeming to their ardent love. Into the song and music there it entered; 390 \nAnd fixed on them my Lady kept her look, Even as a bride silent and motionless. \"This is the one who lay upon the breast Of him our Pelican; and this is he To the great office from the cross elected.\" My Lady thus; but therefore none the more Did move her sight from its attentive gaze Before or afterward these words of hers. Even as a man who gazes, and endeavours To see the eclipsing of the sun a little, And who, by seeing, sightless doth become, So I became before that latest fire, While it was said, \"Why dost thou daze thyself To see a thing which here hath no existence? Earth in the earth my body is, and shall be With all the others there, until our number With the eternal proposition tallies.

The being of the world, and my own being, The death which He endured that I may live, And that which all the faithful hope, as I do, With the forementioned vivid consciousness Have drawn me from the sea of love perverse, And of the right have placed me on the shore. The leaves, wherewith embowered is all the garden Of the Eternal Gardener, do I love As much as he has granted them of good.\" As soon as I had ceased, a song most sweet Throughout the heaven resounded, and my Lady Said with the others, \"Holy, holy, holy!\" 393 \nAnd as at some keen light one wakes from sleep By reason of the visual spirit that runs Unto the splendour passed from coat to coat, And he who wakes abhorreth what he sees, So all unconscious is his sudden waking, Until the judgment cometh to his aid, So from before mine eyes did Beatrice Chase every mote with radiance of her own, That cast its light a thousand miles and more. Whence better after than before I saw, And in a kind of wonderment I asked About a fourth light that I saw with us. And said my Lady: \"There within those rays Gazes upon its Maker the first soul That ever the first virtue did create.\" Even as the bough that downward bends its top At transit of the wind, and then is lifted By its own virtue, which inclines it upward, Likewise did I, the while that she was speaking, Being amazed, and then I was made bold By a desire to speak wherewith I burned. And I began: \"O apple, that mature Alone hast been produced, O ancient father, To whom each wife is daughter and daughter-in-law, Devoutly as I can I supplicate thee That thou wouldst speak to me; thou seest my wish; And I, to hear thee quickly, speak it not.\" Sometimes an animal, when covered, struggles So that his impulse needs must be apparent, By reason of the wrappage following it; And in like manner the primeval soul Made clear to me athwart its covering How jubilant it was to give me pleasure. Then breathed: \"Without thy uttering it to me, Thine inclination better I discern Than thou whatever thing is surest to thee; For I behold it in the truthful mirror, That of Himself all things parhelion makes, And none makes Him parhelion of itself. Thou fain wouldst hear how long ago God placed me 394 \nWithin the lofty garden, where this Lady Unto so long a stairway thee disposed. And how long to mine eyes it was a pleasure, And of the great disdain the proper cause, And the language that I used and that I made. Now, son of mine, the tasting of the tree Not in itself was cause of so great exile, But solely the o'erstepping of the bounds. There, whence thy Lady moved Virgilius, Four thousand and three hundred and two circuits Made by the sun, this Council I desired; And him I saw return to all the lights Of his highway nine hundred times and thirty, Whilst I upon the earth was tarrying. The language that I spake was quite extinct Before that in the work interminable The people under Nimrod were employed; For nevermore result of reasoning (Because of human pleasure that doth change, Obedient to the heavens) was durable. A natural action is it that man speaks; But whether thus or thus, doth nature leave To your own art, as seemeth best to you. Ere I descended to the infernal anguish, 'El' was on earth the name of the Chief Good, From whom comes all the joy that wraps me round 'Eli' he then was called, and that is proper, Because the use of men is like a leaf On bough, which goeth and another cometh. Upon the mount that highest o'er the wave Rises was I, in life or pure or sinful, From the first hour to that which is the second, As the sun changes quadrant, to the sixth.\" 395",
      "modern": "While I was struggling with my vision gone dark,\nfrom the blazing flame that had blinded me\ncame a voice that made me listen closely,\n\nsaying: \"While you recover the power\nof sight that you've consumed in me,\n\n\"You have consumed yourself in me—let your speaking now make recompense for that. \nBegin then, and tell me what your soul aims toward, and know with certainty \nthat your sight is bewildered, not destroyed, \nbecause the Lady who guides you through this divine realm \ncarries in her gaze the same power that Ananias held in his hands.\"\n\nI said: \"Whether soon or late, as it pleases her, \nlet the cure come to these eyes that were doorways \nwhen she entered, bringing the fire I burn with eternally. \nThe Good that gives contentment to this Court \nis the Alpha and Omega of all \nthe scripture that love reads to me, soft or loud.\"\n\nThe same voice that had taken from me \nthe terror of that sudden blazing light \nstirred my thoughts to speak further, \nand said: \"You must sift with a finer mesh— \nyou must tell me who aimed your bow at such a target.\"\n\nAnd I replied: \"Through philosophical reasoning \nand through authority that descends from here, \nsuch love must imprint itself upon me. \nFor Good, insofar as it is good, when understood \nimmediately kindles love, and burns brighter \nthe more goodness it contains within itself. \n\nTherefore toward that Essence—which holds such supremacy \nthat every good found outside it \nis nothing but a ray of its own light— \nmore than anywhere else must the mind be drawn \nof everyone who loves and who perceives \nthe truth on which this proof is founded.\n\nThis truth is revealed to me by him \nwho demonstrates the first love \nof all eternal substances. \nIt is revealed by the voice of the truthful Author \nwho says to Moses, speaking of himself: \n'I will make all my goodness pass before you.' \nAnd you reveal it to me as well, beginning \nthat mighty Gospel which proclaims heaven's secret \nto earth above all other proclamations.\"\n\nAnd I heard: \"By human reason \nand by the authority that accords with it, \nhold God as the highest of all your loves. \nBut tell me again if you feel other cords \ndrawing you toward him—proclaim \nwith how many teeth this love is biting you.\"\n\nThe holy purpose of Christ's Eagle \nwas not hidden from me—rather I perceived \nwhere he wished to lead my confession. \nTherefore I began again: \"All those bites \nthat have the power to turn the heart toward God \nhave worked together in my love.\n\nThe existence of the world and my own existence, \nthe death he endured so that I might live, \nand that which all believers hope for, as I do, \nalong with the living knowledge I spoke of— \nthese have drawn me from the sea of perverted love \nand placed me on the shore of righteous love.\n\nThe leaves with which the Eternal Gardener's \nentire garden is adorned, I love them \nin proportion to the good he has granted them.\"\n\nAs soon as I finished speaking, the sweetest song \nresounded through all heaven, and my Lady \njoined the others, singing \"Holy, holy, holy!\"\n\nAnd just as someone wakes from sleep at bright light, \nas the visual spirit races toward \nthe splendor passed from layer to layer, \nand the sleeper recoils from what he sees, \nso unconscious in his sudden waking \nuntil judgment comes to his aid— \nso Beatrice chased every speck from my eyes \nwith the radiance of her own, \nwhich cast light for a thousand miles and more.\n\nI saw better afterward than before, \nand in a kind of wonder I asked \nabout a fourth light I saw with us. \nMy Lady said: \"Within those rays \nthe first soul that the First Power ever created \ngazes upon its Maker.\"\n\nAs a branch bends its crown downward \nwhen the wind passes, then lifts up again \nby its own nature that inclines it upward, \nso I did while she was speaking— \namazed at first, then made bold \nby the desire to speak that burned in me.\n\nAnd I began: \"O fruit that was brought forth \nmature and alone, O ancient father \nto whom every wife is daughter and daughter-in-law, \nas devoutly as I can, I beg you \nto speak with me. You see my wish, \nand I don't voice it, wanting to hear you sooner.\"\n\nSometimes a covered animal struggles \nso that its movement must be apparent \nbecause the covering follows its motion. \nIn the same way that first soul \nshowed me through its wrapping \nhow joyful it was to give me pleasure.\n\nThen it breathed: \"Without your speaking it, \nI perceive your desire better \nthan you know anything most certain to you. \nFor I see it in the truthful mirror \nthat makes all things reflections of itself \nwhile nothing can make it a reflection of anything else.\n\nYou want to hear how long ago God placed me \nin the high garden where this Lady \nprepared you for so long a climb, \nand how long it delighted my eyes, \nand the true cause of the great anger, \nand the language I used and made.\n\nNow know, my son: the tasting of the tree \nwas not in itself the cause of such great exile, \nbut only the transgression of the boundary.\n\nFrom the place where your Lady summoned Virgil, \nthrough four thousand three hundred and two revolutions \nof the sun, I longed for this assembly. \nAnd I saw the sun return to all the stars \nof its path nine hundred and thirty times \nwhile I remained upon the earth.\n\nThe language I spoke was already extinct \nbefore Nimrod's people undertook \ntheir impossible work. \nFor no product of human reason \nwas ever lasting, since human desire changes \nin obedience to the heavens.\n\nThat humans speak is natural, \nbut whether this way or that, nature leaves \nto your own choice, as seems best to you.\n\nBefore I descended to the infernal anguish, \n'El' was the name on earth for the Supreme Good \nfrom whom comes all the joy that wraps around me. \nLater he was called 'Eli,' and this is fitting, \nfor human usage is like a leaf \non a branch—one falls and another comes.\n\nOn the mountain that rises highest above the waters \nI lived, both innocent and guilty, \nfrom the first hour until the one that follows \nthe sixth, when the sun changes quadrant.\"",

O perfect life of love and peacefulness! O riches without hankering secure! Before mine eyes were standing the four torches Enkindled, and the one that first had come Began to make itself more luminous; And even such in semblance it became As Jupiter would become, if he and Mars Were birds, and they should interchange their feathers. That Providence, which here distributeth Season and service, in the blessed choir Had silence upon every side imposed. When I heard say: \"If I my colour change, Marvel not at it; for while I am speaking Thou shalt behold all these their colour change. He who usurps upon the earth my place, My place, my place, which vacant has become Before the presence of the Son of God, Has of my cemetery made a sewer Of blood and stench, whereby the Perverse One, Who fell from here, below there is appeased!\" With the same colour which, through sun adverse, Painteth the clouds at evening or at morn, 396 Beheld I then the whole of heaven suffused. And as a modest woman, who abides Sure of herself, and at another's failing, From listening only, timorous becomes, Even thus did Beatrice change countenance; And I believe in heaven was such eclipse, When suffered the supreme Omnipotence; Thereafterward proceeded forth his words With voice so much transmuted from itself, The very countenance was not more changed. \"The spouse of Christ has never nurtured been On blood of mine, of Linus and of Cletus, To be made use of in acquest of gold; But in acquest of this delightful life Sixtus and Pius, Urban and Calixtus, After much lamentation, shed their blood. Our purpose was not, that on the right hand Of our successors should in part be seated The Christian folk, in part upon the other; Nor that the keys which were to me confided Should e'er become the escutcheon on a banner, That should wage war on those who are baptized; Nor I be made the figure of a seal To privileges venal and mendacious, Whereat I often redden and flash with fire. In garb of shepherds the rapacious wolves Are seen from here above o'er all the pastures! O wrath of God, why dost thou slumber still? To drink our blood the Caorsines and Gascons Are making ready. O thou good beginning, Unto how vile an end must thou needs fall! But the high Providence, that with Scipio At Rome the glory of the world defended, Will speedily bring aid, as I conceive; And thou, my son, who by thy mortal weight Shalt down return again, open thy mouth; What I conceal not, do not thou conceal.\" As with its frozen vapours downward falls In flakes our atmosphere, what time the horn Of the celestial Goat doth touch the sun, 397 \nUpward in such array saw I the ether Become, and flaked with the triumphant vapours, Which there together with us had remained. My sight was following up their semblances, And followed till the medium, by excess, The passing farther onward took from it; Whereat the Lady, who beheld me freed From gazing upward, said to me: \"Cast down Thy sight, and see how far thou art turned round.\" Since the first time that I had downward looked, I saw that I had moved through the whole arc Which the first climate makes from midst to end; So that I saw the mad track of Ulysses Past Gades, and this side, well nigh the shore Whereon became Europa a sweet burden. And of this threshing-floor the site to me Were more unveiled, but the sun was proceeding Under my feet, a sign and more removed. My mind enamoured, which is dallying At all times with my Lady, to bring back To her mine eyes was more than ever ardent. And if or Art or Nature has made bait To catch the eyes and so possess the mind, In human flesh or in its portraiture, All joined together would appear as nought To the divine delight which shone upon me When to her smiling face I turned me round. The virtue that her look endowed me with From the fair nest of Leda tore me forth, And up into the swiftest heaven impelled me. Its parts exceeding full of life and lofty Are all so uniform, I cannot say Which Beatrice selected for my place. But she, who was aware of my desire, Began, the while she smiled so joyously That God seemed in her countenance to rejoice: \"The nature of that motion, which keeps quiet The centre and all the rest about it moves, From hence begins as from its starting point. And in this heaven there is no other Where 398 \nThan in the Mind Divine, wherein is kindled The love that turns it, and the power it rains. Within a circle light and love embrace it, Even as this doth the others, and that precinct He who encircles it alone controls. Its motion is not by another meted, But all the others measured are by this, As ten is by the half and by the fifth. And in what manner time in such a pot May have its roots, and in the rest its leaves, Now unto thee can manifest be made. O Covetousness, that mortals dost ingulf Beneath thee so, that no one hath the power Of drawing back his eyes from out thy waves! Full fairly blossoms in mankind the will; But the uninterrupted rain converts Into abortive wildings the true plums. Fidelity and innocence are found Only in children; afterwards they both Take flight or e'er the cheeks with down are covered. One, while he prattles still, observes the fasts, Who, when his tongue is loosed, forthwith devours Whatever food under whatever moon; Another, while he prattles, loves and listens Unto his mother, who when speech is perfect Forthwith desires to see her in her grave. Even thus is swarthy made the skin so white In its first aspect of the daughter fair Of him who brings the morn, and leaves the night. Thou, that it may not be a marvel to thee, Think that on earth there is no one who governs; Whence goes astray the human family. Ere January be unwintered wholly By the centesimal on earth neglected, Shall these supernal circles roar so loud The tempest that has been so long awaited Shall whirl the poops about where are the prows; So that the fleet shall run its course direct, And the true fruit shall follow on the flower.\" 399",

      "original": "After the truth against the present life Of miserable mortals was unfolded By her who doth imparadise my mind, As in a looking-glass a taper's flame He sees who from behind is lighted by it, Before he has it in his sight or thought, And turns him round to see if so the glass Tell him the truth, and sees that it accords Therewith as doth a music with its metre, In similar wise my memory recollecteth That I did, looking into those fair eyes, Of which Love made the springes to ensnare me. And as I turned me round, and mine were touched By that which is apparent in that volume, Whenever on its gyre we gaze intent, A point beheld I, that was raying out Light so acute, the sight which it enkindles Must close perforce before such great acuteness. And whatsoever star seems smallest here Would seem to be a moon, if placed beside it. As one star with another star is placed. Perhaps at such a distance as appears A halo cincturing the light that paints it, When densest is the vapour that sustains it, Thus distant round the point a circle of fire So swiftly whirled, that it would have surpassed Whatever motion soonest girds the world; And this was by another circumcinct, That by a third, the third then by a fourth, By a fifth the fourth, and then by a sixth the fifth; 400 The seventh followed thereupon in width So ample now, that Juno's messenger Entire would be too narrow to contain it. Even so the eighth and ninth; and every one More slowly moved, according as it was In number distant farther from the first. And that one had its flame most crystalline From which less distant was the stainless spark, I think because more with its truth imbued. My Lady, who in my anxiety Beheld me much perplexed, said: \"From that point Dependent is the heaven and nature all. Behold that circle most conjoined to it, And know thou, that its motion is so swift Through burning love whereby it is spurred on.\" And I to her: \"If the world were arranged In the order which I see in yonder wheels, What's set before me would have satisfied me; But in the world of sense we can perceive That evermore the circles are diviner As they are from the centre more remote Wherefore if my desire is to be ended In this miraculous and angelic temple, That has for confines only love and light, To hear behoves me still how the example And the exemplar go not in one fashion, Since for myself in vain I contemplate it.\" \"If thine own fingers unto such a knot Be insufficient, it is no great wonder, So hard hath it become for want of trying.\" My Lady thus; then said she: \"Do thou take What I shall tell thee, if thou wouldst be sated, And exercise on that thy subtlety. The circles corporal are wide and narrow According to the more or less of virtue Which is distributed through all their parts. The greater goodness works the greater weal, The greater weal the greater body holds, If perfect equally are all its parts. Therefore this one which sweeps along with it 401 \nThe universe sublime, doth correspond Unto the circle which most loves and knows. On which account, if thou unto the virtue Apply thy measure, not to the appearance Of substances that unto thee seem round, Thou wilt behold a marvellous agreement, Of more to greater, and of less to smaller, In every heaven, with its Intelligence.\" Even as remaineth splendid and serene The hemisphere of air, when Boreas Is blowing from that cheek where he is mildest, Because is purified and resolved the rack That erst disturbed it, till the welkin laughs With all the beauties of its pageantry; Thus did I likewise, after that my Lady Had me provided with her clear response, And like a star in heaven the truth was seen. And soon as to a stop her words had come, Not otherwise does iron scintillate When molten, than those circles scintillated. Their coruscation all the sparks repeated, And they so many were, their number makes More millions than the doubling of the chess. I heard them sing hosanna choir by choir To the fixed point which holds them at the 'Ubi,' And ever will, where they have ever been. And she, who saw the dubious meditations Within my mind, \"The primal circles,\" said, \"Have shown thee Seraphim and Cherubim. Thus rapidly they follow their own bonds, To be as like the point as most they can, And can as far as they are high in vision. Those other Loves, that round about them go, Thrones of the countenance divine are called, Because they terminate the primal Triad. And thou shouldst know that they all have delight As much as their own vision penetrates The Truth, in which all intellect finds rest. From this it may be seen how blessedness Is founded in the faculty which sees, 402 \nAnd not in that which loves, and follows next; And of this seeing merit is the measure, Which is brought forth by grace, and by good will; Thus on from grade to grade doth it proceed. The second Triad, which is germinating In such wise in this sempiternal spring, That no nocturnal Aries despoils, Perpetually hosanna warbles forth With threefold melody, that sounds in three Orders of joy, with which it is intrined. The three Divine are in this hierarchy, First the Dominions, and the Virtues next; And the third order is that of the Powers. Then in the dances twain penultimate The Principalities and Archangels wheel; The last is wholly of angelic sports. These orders upward all of them are gazing, And downward so prevail, that unto God They all attracted are and all attract. And Dionysius with so great desire To contemplate these Orders set himself, He named them and distinguished them as I do. But Gregory afterwards dissented from him; Wherefore, as soon as he unclosed his eyes Within this heaven, he at himself did smile. And if so much of secret truth a mortal Proffered on earth, I would not have thee marvel, For he who saw it here revealed it to him, With much more of the truth about these circles.\" 403",
      "modern": "After the truth about the present life\nof wretched mortals was revealed\nby her who fills my mind with paradise,\n\nLike someone who sees a candle's flame reflected in a mirror,\nlit from behind before they turn to look directly at the source,\nthen spins around to check if the glass tells the truth,\nfinding perfect harmony between reflection and reality\nlike music matching its own rhythm—\nso I remember doing as I gazed into those beautiful eyes\nthat Love had made into snares to capture me.\n\nAnd when I turned, my own eyes touched\nby what appears in that revolving sphere\nwhenever we focus our intent gaze upon it,\nI saw a point radiating light so sharp and piercing\nthat any sight it kindles must close tight\nagainst such overwhelming brilliance.\nWhatever star appears smallest from earth\nwould seem a moon if placed beside this point,\nas close as one star sits next to another.\n\nPerhaps at the distance where a halo appears\nto circle the light that paints it\nwhen the mist holding it grows thickest—\nat such a distance around the point, a ring of fire\nspun so swiftly it would have outpaced\nwhatever motion fastest girds our world.\nThis ring was circled by another,\nthat by a third, the third by a fourth,\nthe fourth by a fifth, then a sixth around the fifth.\n\nThe seventh spread so wide in its circumference\nthat Juno's rainbow messenger entire\nwould be too narrow to contain it.\nSo too the eighth and ninth, and each one\nmoved more slowly as its number placed it\nfarther distant from the first.\nThe ring whose flame burned most crystal-clear\nwas closest to that stainless spark,\nbecause, I think, it drinks most deeply of its truth.\n\nMy Lady, seeing me bewildered and perplexed,\nsaid: \"From that point depends\nall heaven and all nature.\nLook at the circle joined most close to it—\nknow that its motion burns so swift\nbecause of the blazing love that spurs it on.\"\n\nAnd I replied: \"If the world were arranged\nin the same order I see in those wheels above,\nwhat you've set before me would satisfy me completely.\nBut in our world of the senses, we perceive\nthat the circles grow more divine\nthe farther they sit from the center.\nIf my longing is to find its end\nin this miraculous temple made of angels,\nbounded only by love and light,\nI still need to understand how the model\nand what it models don't follow the same pattern—\nI contemplate this puzzle in vain.\"\n\n\"If your own fingers prove insufficient\nfor such a knot, it's no great wonder—\nit has grown hard from lack of trying.\"\nSo spoke my Lady, then continued:\n\"Take what I tell you if you want satisfaction,\nand sharpen your mind upon it.\n\nThe physical spheres are wide or narrow\naccording to how much virtue\nflows distributed through all their parts.\nGreater goodness creates greater blessing,\ngreater blessing fills a greater body\nwhen all its parts achieve equal perfection.\nTherefore this sphere that sweeps along\nthe entire sublime universe corresponds\nto the circle that most loves and knows.\n\nIf you apply your measure to their power,\nnot to the mere appearance\nof the substances that seem round to you,\nyou'll see a marvelous correspondence—\ngreater to more, and smaller to less—\nin every heaven with its guiding Intelligence.\"\n\nJust as the hemisphere of air remains\nsplendid and serene when the north wind\nblows from his gentler side,\npurified and clearing away the haze\nthat once disturbed it, until the sky laughs\nwith all the beauties of its pageantry—\nso I became, once my Lady\nprovided me her luminous answer,\nand like a star in heaven, the truth appeared.\n\nAs soon as her words came to a stop,\nthose circles blazed and sparkled\nexactly like molten iron when it's stirred.\nEach spark repeated their coruscation,\nand they were so many that their number\nmakes more millions than the doubling of the chessboard.\n\nI heard them singing \"Hosanna\" choir by choir\nto the fixed point that holds them in their place\nand always will, where they have always been.\nAnd she who saw the doubtful meditations\nwithin my mind said: \"The first circles\nhave shown you Seraphim and Cherubim.\nThey follow their bonds with such speed\nto become as much like the point as possible,\nand they can, as far as they soar high in vision.\n\nThose other Loves that wheel around them\nare called Thrones of the divine countenance,\ncompleting the first Triad.\nYou should know they all find their delight\nexactly as far as their

force\nthat all draw toward God and all attract.\nDionysius set himself with such great longing\nto contemplate these Orders\nthat he named and ranked them as I do.\n\nBut Gregory later disagreed with him,\nso when he opened his eyes\nwithin this heaven, he smiled at himself.\nAnd if a mortal revealed so much\nsecret truth on earth, don't be amazed—\nthe one who saw it here disclosed it to

      "original": "At what time both the children of Latona, Surmounted by the Ram and by the Scales, Together make a zone of the horizon, As long as from the time the zenith holds them In equipoise, till from that girdle both Changing their hemisphere disturb the balance, So long, her face depicted with a smile, Did Beatrice keep silence while she gazed Fixedly at the point which had o'ercome me. Then she began: \"I say, and I ask not What thou dost wish to hear, for I have seen it Where centres every When and every 'Ubi.' Not to acquire some good unto himself, Which is impossible, but that his splendour In its resplendency may say, 'Subsisto,' In his eternity outside of time, Outside all other limits, as it pleased him, Into new Loves the Eternal Love unfolded. Nor as if torpid did he lie before; For neither after nor before proceeded The going forth of God upon these waters. Matter and Form unmingled and conjoined Came into being that had no defect, E'en as three arrows from a three-stringed bow. And as in glass, in amber, or in crystal A sunbeam flashes so, that from its coming To its full being is no interval, So from its Lord did the triform effect 404 Ray forth into its being all together, Without discrimination of beginning. Order was con-created and constructed In substances, and summit of the world Were those wherein the pure act was produced. Pure potentiality held the lowest part; Midway bound potentiality with act Such bond that it shall never be unbound. Jerome has written unto you of angels Created a long lapse of centuries Or ever yet the other world was made; But written is this truth in many places By writers of the Holy Ghost, and thou Shalt see it, if thou lookest well thereat. And even reason seeth it somewhat, For it would not concede that for so long Could be the motors without their perfection. Now dost thou know both where and when these Loves Created were, and how; so that extinct In thy desire already are three fires. Nor could one reach, in counting, unto twenty So swiftly, as a portion of these angels Disturbed the subject of your elements. The rest remained, and they began this art Which thou discernest, with so great delight That never from their circling do they cease. The occasion of the fall was the accursed Presumption of that One, whom thou hast seen By all the burden of the world constrained. Those whom thou here beholdest modest were To recognise themselves as of that goodness Which made them apt for so much understanding; On which account their vision was exalted By the enlightening grace and their own merit, So that they have a full and steadfast will. I would not have thee doubt, but certain be, 'Tis meritorious to receive this grace, According as the affection opens to it. Now round about in this consistory Much mayst thou contemplate, if these my words 405 \nBe gathered up, without all further aid. But since upon the earth, throughout your schools, They teach that such is the angelic nature That it doth hear, and recollect, and will, More will I say, that thou mayst see unmixed The truth that is confounded there below, Equivocating in such like prelections. These substances, since in God's countenance They jocund were, turned not away their sight From that wherefrom not anything is hidden; Hence they have not their vision intercepted By object new, and hence they do not need To recollect, through interrupted thought. So that below, not sleeping, people dream, Believing they speak truth, and not believing; And in the last is greater sin and shame. Below you do not journey by one path Philosophising; so transporteth you Love of appearance and the thought thereof. And even this above here is endured With less disdain, than when is set aside The Holy Writ, or when it is distorted. They think not there how much of blood it costs To sow it in the world, and how he pleases Who in humility keeps close to it. Each striveth for appearance, and doth make His own inventions; and these treated are By preachers, and the Evangel holds its peace. One sayeth that the moon did backward turn, In the Passion of Christ, and interpose herself So that the sunlight reached not down below; And lies; for of its own accord the light Hid itself; whence to Spaniards and to Indians, As to the Jews, did such eclipse respond. Florence has not so many Lapi and Bindi As fables such as these, that every year Are shouted from the pulpit back and forth, In such wise that the lambs, who do not know, Come back from pasture fed upon the wind, And not to see the harm doth not excuse them. 406 \nChrist did not to his first disciples say, 'Go forth, and to the world preach idle tales,' But unto them a true foundation gave; And this so loudly sounded from their lips, That, in the warfare to enkindle Faith, They made of the Evangel shields and lances. Now men go forth with jests and drolleries To preach, and if but well the people laugh, The hood puffs out, and nothing more is asked. But in the cowl there nestles such a bird, That, if the common people were to see it, They would perceive what pardons they confide in, For which so great on earth has grown the folly, That, without proof of any testimony, To each indulgence they would flock together. By this Saint Anthony his pig doth fatten, And many others, who are worse than pigs, Paying in money without mark of coinage. But since we have digressed abundantly, Turn back thine eyes forthwith to the right path, So that the way be shortened with the time. This nature doth so multiply itself In numbers, that there never yet was speech Nor mortal fancy that can go so far. And if thou notest that which is revealed By Daniel, thou wilt see that in his thousands Number determinate is kept concealed. The primal light, that all irradiates it, By modes as many is received therein, As are the splendours wherewith it is mated. Hence, inasmuch as on the act conceptive The affection followeth, of love the sweetness Therein diversely fervid is or tepid. The height behold now and the amplitude Of the eternal power, since it hath made Itself so many mirrors, where 'tis broken, One in itself remaining as before.\" 407",
      "modern": "At the moment when both children of Latona—\nthe sun crowned by the Ram, the moon by the Scales—\ntogether form a belt across the horizon,\n\nFor as long as the scales of heaven hold the sun and moon\nin perfect balance at the zenith,\nuntil both shift hemispheres and tip the equilibrium—\nthat's how long Beatrice kept silent,\nher face lit with a smile,\ngazing steadily at the point of light that had overwhelmed me.\n\nThen she began: \"I will tell you what I know you long to hear,\nthough you haven't asked.\nI have seen it all where every When and Where converges.\nNot to gain anything for himself—impossible—\nbut so his splendor might declare through its radiance: 'I exist.'\n\nIn his eternity beyond time,\nbeyond all boundaries, as it pleased him,\nEternal Love opened into new loves.\nHe was not lying dormant before this moment—\nthere was no 'before' or 'after'\nwhen God moved upon these waters.\n\nMatter and Form, separate yet joined,\ncame into being without flaw,\nlike three arrows released simultaneously\nfrom a three-stringed bow.\nAnd just as sunlight flashes through glass,\namber, or crystal with no delay\nbetween its arrival and full presence,\nso this threefold creation\nblazed forth from its Lord all at once,\nwith no sequence of beginning.\n\nOrder was created alongside the substances themselves.\nAt the summit of the world\nwere placed those beings of pure action—the angels.\nAt the bottom, pure potential—raw matter.\nIn between, potential bound to action\nby a bond that can never be broken.\n\nJerome wrote that angels were created\nlong ages before the material world,\nbut this truth appears in many places\nwritten by the Holy Spirit's scribes—\nyou'll find it if you look carefully.\nEven reason glimpses this,\nfor it makes no sense that the movers of the spheres\nwould lack their perfection for so long.\n\nNow you know where and when and how\nthese Loves were created—\nthree fires of curiosity

muddled down there\nby equivocation in such lessons.\n\nThese beings, joyful in God's presence,\nnever turn their gaze away\nfrom the one from whom nothing is hidden.\nSo their vision is never blocked by new objects,\nnor do they need to remember\nthrough interrupted thought.\n\nYet below, people dream while awake,\nsome believing they speak truth, others not—\nthe latter bear greater sin and shame.\nYou don't follow one path in philosophy;\nlove of appearances and thinking about them\ncarries you away.\n\nEven this is tolerated here with less scorn\nthan when Holy Scripture is set

making up his own ideas,\nand preachers expound on these\nwhile the Gospel falls silent.\nOne claims the moon reversed course\nduring Christ's Passion, blocking the sun\nso light couldn't reach below—\na lie, for the light hid itself willingly,\nand this eclipse reached Spaniards and Indians\nas well as Jews.\n\nFlorence doesn't have as many men named Lapi and Bindi\nas there are fables like

      "original": "Perchance six thousand miles remote from us Is glowing the sixth hour, and now this world Inclines its shadow almost to a level, When the mid-heaven begins to make itself So deep to us, that here and there a star Ceases to shine so far down as this depth, And as advances bright exceedingly The handmaid of the sun, the heaven is closed Light after light to the most beautiful; Not otherwise the Triumph, which for ever Plays round about the point that vanquished me, Seeming enclosed by what itself encloses, Little by little from my vision faded; Whereat to turn mine eyes on Beatrice My seeing nothing and my love constrained me. If what has hitherto been said of her Were all concluded in a single praise, Scant would it be to serve the present turn. Not only does the beauty I beheld Transcend ourselves, but truly I believe Its Maker only may enjoy it all. Vanquished do I confess me by this passage More than by problem of his theme was ever O'ercome the comic or the tragic poet; For as the sun the sight that trembles most, Even so the memory of that sweet smile My mind depriveth of its very self. From the first day that I beheld her face 408 In this life, to the moment of this look, The sequence of my song has ne'er been severed; But now perforce this sequence must desist From following her beauty with my verse, As every artist at his uttermost. Such as I leave her to a greater fame Than any of my trumpet, which is bringing Its arduous matter to a final close, With voice and gesture of a perfect leader She recommenced: \"We from the greatest body Have issued to the heaven that is pure light; Light intellectual replete with love, Love of true good replete with ecstasy, Ecstasy that transcendeth every sweetness. Here shalt thou see the one host and the other Of Paradise, and one in the same aspects Which at the final judgment thou shalt see.\" Even as a sudden lightning that disperses The visual spirits, so that it deprives The eye of impress from the strongest objects, Thus round about me flashed a living light, And left me swathed around with such a veil Of its effulgence, that I nothing saw. \"Ever the Love which quieteth this heaven Welcomes into itself with such salute, To make the candle ready for its flame.\" No sooner had within me these brief words An entrance found, than I perceived myself To be uplifted over my own power, And I with vision new rekindled me, Such that no light whatever is so pure But that mine eyes were fortified against it. And light I saw in fashion of a river Fulvid with its effulgence, 'twixt two banks Depicted with an admirable Spring. Out of this river issued living sparks, And on all sides sank down into the flowers, Like unto rubies that are set in gold; And then, as if inebriate with the odours, They plunged again into the wondrous torrent, 409 \nAnd as one entered issued forth another. \"The high desire, that now inflames and moves thee To have intelligence of what thou seest, Pleaseth me all the more, the more it swells. But of this water it behoves thee drink Before so great a thirst in thee be slaked.\" Thus said to me the sunshine of mine eyes; And added: \"The river and the topazes Going in and out, and the laughing of the herbage, Are of their truth foreshadowing prefaces; Not that these things are difficult in themselves, But the deficiency is on thy side, For yet thou hast not vision so exalted.\" There is no babe that leaps so suddenly With face towards the milk, if he awake Much later than his usual custom is, As I did, that I might make better mirrors Still of mine eyes, down stooping to the wave Which flows that we therein be better made. And even as the penthouse of mine eyelids Drank of it, it forthwith appeared to me Out of its length to be transformed to round. Then as a folk who have been under masks Seem other than before, if they divest The semblance not their own they disappeared in, Thus into greater pomp were changed for me The flowerets and the sparks, so that I saw Both of the Courts of Heaven made manifest. O splendour of God! by means of which I saw The lofty triumph of the realm veracious, Give me the power to say how it I saw! There is a light above, which visible Makes the Creator unto every creature, Who only in beholding Him has peace, And it expands itself in circular form To such extent, that its circumference Would be too large a girdle for the sun. The semblance of it is all made of rays Reflected from the top of Primal Motion, Which takes therefrom vitality and power. 410 \nAnd as a hill in water at its base Mirrors itself, as if to see its beauty When affluent most in verdure and in flowers, So, ranged aloft all round about the light, Mirrored I saw in more ranks than a thousand All who above there have from us returned. And if the lowest row collect within it So great a light, how vast the amplitude Is of this Rose in its extremest leaves! My vision in the vastness and the height Lost not itself, but comprehended all The quantity and quality of that gladness. There near and far nor add nor take away; For there where God immediately doth govern, The natural law in naught is relevant. Into the yellow of the Rose Eternal That spreads, and multiplies, and breathes an odour Of praise unto the ever-vernal Sun, As one who silent is and fain would speak, Me Beatrice drew on, and said: \"Behold Of the white stoles how vast the convent is! Behold how vast the circuit of our city! Behold our seats so filled to overflowing, That here henceforward are few people wanting! On that great throne whereon thine eyes are fixed For the crown's sake already placed upon it, Before thou suppest at this wedding feast Shall sit the soul (that is to be Augustus On earth) of noble Henry, who shall come To redress Italy ere she be ready. Blind covetousness, that casts its spell upon you, Has made you like unto the little child, Who dies of hunger and drives off the nurse. And in the sacred forum then shall be A Prefect such, that openly or covert On the same road he will not walk with him. But long of God he will not be endured In holy office; he shall be thrust down Where Simon Magus is for his deserts, And make him of Alagna lower go!\" 411",
      "modern": "Perhaps six thousand miles away\n\nThe sixth hour blazes above us, and this world\ntilts its shadow nearly flat against the earth,\nwhile the depths of heaven grow so profound\nthat

sight.\nJust so, the eternal Triumph\nthat plays forever around the point that conquered me—\nseeming enclosed by what it itself encloses—\nslowly faded from my vision.\n\nThis forced me to turn my eyes back to Beatrice,\nmy inability to see anything else\nand my love both compelling me.\nIf everything I have said of her until now\ncould be gathered into a single song of praise,\nit would still be inadequate for this moment.\n\nThe beauty I beheld not only transcends\nour human understanding—I truly believe\nonly its Creator can fully comprehend it.\nI confess myself defeated by this

the golden gems\nentering and leaving, and the laughter of the grass—\nthese are shadowy prefaces of their truth.\nNot that these things are difficult in themselves,\nbut the deficiency lies with you,\nfor your vision is not yet sufficiently elevated.\"\n\nNo baby leaps so suddenly toward milk,\nawakening much later than usual,\nas I did, bending down to the wave\nto make better mirrors of my

      "original": "The Glory of Paradise. Departure of Beatrice. St. Bernard. In fashion then as of a snow-white rose Displayed itself to me the saintly host, Whom Christ in his own blood had made his bride, But the other host, that flying sees and sings The glory of Him who doth enamour it, And the goodness that created it so noble, Even as a swarm of bees, that sinks in flowers One moment, and the next returns again To where its labour is to sweetness turned, Sank into the great flower, that is adorned With leaves so many, and thence reascended To where its love abideth evermore. Their faces had they all of living flame, And wings of gold, and all the rest so white No snow unto that limit doth attain. From bench to bench, into the flower descending, They carried something of the peace and ardour Which by the fanning of their flanks they won. Nor did the interposing 'twixt the flower And what was o'er it of such plenitude Of flying shapes impede the sight and splendour; Because the light divine so penetrates The universe, according to its merit, That naught can be an obstacle against it. This realm secure and full of gladsomeness, Crowded with ancient people and with modern, Unto one mark had all its look and love. O Trinal Light, that in a single star Sparkling upon their sight so satisfies them, 412 Look down upon our tempest here below! If the barbarians, coming from some region That every day by Helice is covered, Revolving with her son whom she delights in, Beholding Rome and all her noble works, Were wonder-struck, what time the Lateran Above all mortal things was eminent,— I who to the divine had from the human, From time unto eternity, had come, From Florence to a people just and sane, With what amazement must I have been filled! Truly between this and the joy, it was My pleasure not to hear, and to be mute. And as a pilgrim who delighteth him In gazing round the temple of his vow, And hopes some day to retell how it was, So through the living light my way pursuing Directed I mine eyes o'er all the ranks, Now up, now down, and now all round about. Faces I saw of charity persuasive, Embellished by His light and their own smile, And attitudes adorned with every grace. The general form of Paradise already My glance had comprehended as a whole, In no part hitherto remaining fixed, And round I turned me with rekindled wish My Lady to interrogate of things Concerning which my mind was in suspense. One thing I meant, another answered me; I thought I should see Beatrice, and saw An Old Man habited like the glorious people. O'erflowing was he in his eyes and cheeks With joy benign, in attitude of pity As to a tender father is becoming. And \"She, where is she?\" instantly I said; Whence he: \"To put an end to thy desire, Me Beatrice hath sent from mine own place. And if thou lookest up to the third round Of the first rank, again shalt thou behold her Upon the throne her merits have assigned her.\" 413 \nWithout reply I lifted up mine eyes, And saw her, as she made herself a crown Reflecting from herself the eternal rays. Not from that region which the highest thunders Is any mortal eye so far removed, In whatsoever sea it deepest sinks, As there from Beatrice my sight; but this Was nothing unto me; because her image Descended not to me by medium blurred. \"O Lady, thou in whom my hope is strong, And who for my salvation didst endure In Hell to leave the imprint of thy feet, Of whatsoever things I have beheld, As coming from thy power and from thy goodness I recognise the virtue and the grace. Thou from a slave hast brought me unto freedom, By all those ways, by all the expedients, Whereby thou hadst the power of doing it. Preserve towards me thy magnificence, So that this soul of mine, which thou hast healed, Pleasing to thee be loosened from the body.\" Thus I implored; and she, so far away, Smiled, as it seemed, and looked once more at me; Then unto the eternal fountain turned. And said the Old Man holy: \"That thou mayst Accomplish perfectly thy journeying, Whereunto prayer and holy love have sent me, Fly with thine eyes all round about this garden; For seeing it will discipline thy sight Farther to mount along the ray divine. And she, the Queen of Heaven, for whom I burn Wholly with love, will grant us every grace, Because that I her faithful Bernard am.\" As he who peradventure from Croatia Cometh to gaze at our Veronica, Who through its ancient fame is never sated, But says in thought, the while it is displayed, \"My Lord, Christ Jesus, God of very God, Now was your semblance made like unto this?\" Even such was I while gazing at the living 414 \nCharity of the man, who in this world By contemplation tasted of that peace. \"Thou son of grace, this jocund life,\" began he, \"Will not be known to thee by keeping ever Thine eyes below here on the lowest place; But mark the circles to the most remote, Until thou shalt behold enthroned the Queen To whom this realm is subject and devoted.\" I lifted up mine eyes, and as at morn The oriental part of the horizon Surpasses that wherein the sun goes down, Thus, as if going with mine eyes from vale To mount, I saw a part in the remoteness Surpass in splendour all the other front. And even as there where we await the pole That Phaeton drove badly, blazes more The light, and is on either side diminished, So likewise that pacific oriflamme Gleamed brightest in the centre, and each side In equal measure did the flame abate. And at that centre, with their wings expanded, More than a thousand jubilant Angels saw I, Each differing in effulgence and in kind. I saw there at their sports and at their songs A beauty smiling, which the gladness was Within the eyes of all the other saints; And if I had in speaking as much wealth As in imagining, I should not dare To attempt the smallest part of its delight.

Saint Bernard Appears.**\n\nIn form, then, of a pure white rose\nthe sacred host appeared to me—\nthose whom Christ made his bride with his own blood.\n\nBut the other host, which sees and sings\nthe glory of the One who fills them with love,\nand the goodness that made them so noble,\n\nlike a swarm of bees that one moment\nsettles on the flowers, and the next\nreturns to where their work grows sweet,\n\ndescended into the great flower\nadorned with so many petals,\nthen rose again to where their love dwells always.\n\nTheir faces were all living flame,\ntheir wings were gold, and the rest of them\nso white that no snow could match it.\n\nWhen they descended into the flower,\nfrom tier to tier they shared\nthe peace and fervor they had gained with their wings.\n\nLike a snow-white rose unfolding,\nthe blessed host displayed itself before me—\nthose whom Christ claimed as his bride with his own blood.\n\nBut the other host, which flies and sings\nthe glory of the One who fills them with love,\nand the goodness that made them so noble,\nmoved like a swarm of bees\nthat plunges into flowers one moment\nand returns the next to where their work\ntransforms into sweetness.\n\nThey descended into that great flower\nadorned with countless petals,\nthen rose again to where their love\ndwells forever.\n\nTheir faces were all living flame,\ntheir wings pure gold,\nand all the rest so white\nthat snow could never match that brightness.\nFrom tier to tier, descending through the flower,\nthey carried something of the peace and fire\nthey won by beating their golden wings.\n\nNor did this abundance of flying forms\nbetween the flower and what lay above\nblock the sight or dim the splendor—\nfor divine light penetrates the universe\naccording to each thing's worthiness,\nand nothing can obstruct it.\n\nThis realm, secure and filled with joy,\ncrowded with souls ancient and modern,\nturned all its gaze and love toward one goal.\n\nO Trinity of Light, you who sparkle\nin a single star upon their sight\nand satisfy them completely—\nlook down upon our storm below!\n\nIf barbarians coming from some northern land\nwhere Helice circles daily\nwith her son she delights in,\nwere struck with wonder seeing Rome\nand all her noble works,\nwhen the Lateran towered\nabove all mortal things—\n\nthen I, who had come from human to divine,\nfrom time to eternity,\nfrom Florence to a people just and whole,\nwith what amazement must I have been filled!\n\nTruly, between this wonder and the joy,\nI wanted neither to hear nor speak.\n\nLike a pilgrim who delights\nin gazing around the temple of his vow\nand hopes someday to tell others how it was,\nso I directed my eyes through the living light\nover all the ranks—\nnow up, now down, now all around.\n\nI saw faces glowing with love,\nbeautified by His light and their own smiles,\nand gestures graced with every virtue.\nAlready my glance had taken in\nthe general form of Paradise as a whole,\nlingering on no single part,\nand I turned with renewed desire\nto question my Lady about things\nthat held my mind in suspense.\n\nI expected one thing, but another answered me.\nI thought I would see Beatrice,\nbut instead saw an old man\ndressed like the other glorious souls.\nHis eyes and cheeks overflowed\nwith gentle joy, his bearing\nkind as a tender father's.\n\n\"Where is she?\" I said at once.\n\n\"To fulfill your longing,\" he replied,\n\"Beatrice sent me from my place.\nIf you look up to the third circle\nof the highest tier, you will see her again\nupon the throne her merits have earned.\"\n\nWithout answering, I lifted my eyes\nand saw her as she made herself a crown,\nreflecting the eternal rays.\n\nNo mortal eye is ever so far removed\nfrom the highest thunder clouds,\nhowever deep it sinks beneath the sea,\nas my sight was then from Beatrice.\nBut this meant nothing to me,\nfor her image came down to me\nundimmed by any barrier.\n\n\"O Lady, in whom my hope is strong,\nwho for my salvation endured\nleaving your footprints in Hell—\nof all the things I have seen,\nI recognize the power and grace\nas coming from your goodness.\n\nYou have brought me from slavery to freedom\nby every path, every means\nby which you had the power to do it.\nKeep showing me your magnificence,\nso that my soul, which you have healed,\nmay be released from the body\nin a way that pleases you.\"\n\nSo I prayed. And she, so far away,\nseemed to smile and looked at me once more,\nthen turned toward the eternal fountain.\n\nThe holy old man said: \"So that you may\ncomplete your journey perfectly—\nthe purpose for which prayer and holy love sent me—\nlet your eyes fly around this garden,\nfor seeing it will prepare your sight\nto climb higher along the divine ray.\n\nAnd she, the Queen of Heaven,\nfor whom I burn completely with love,\nwill grant us every grace,\nbecause I am her faithful Bernard.\"\n\nLike someone who perhaps comes from Croatia\nto gaze upon our Veronica,\nnever satisfied by its ancient fame,\nbut thinks while it is displayed,\n\"My Lord Jesus Christ, true God,\nwas your face really like this?\"—\n\nso was I, gazing at the living love\nof the man who in this world,\nthrough contemplation, tasted that peace.\n\n\"Son of grace,\" he began,\n\"you will not know this joyful life\nby keeping your eyes fixed down here\nat the bottom.\nLook at the circles, even the most distant,\nuntil you see the Queen enthroned\nto whom this realm is subject and devoted.\"\n\nI raised my eyes, and as at dawn\nthe eastern horizon\nsurpasses the western where the sun sets,\nso, as if my eyes climbed from valley to mountain,\nI saw one part in the distance\noutshine all the rest in splendor.\n\nAnd just as we see the place\nwhere Phaeton drove so badly\nblaze brightest at the center\nand fade on either side,\nso that peaceful banner of light\ngleamed most brightly in the middle,\ndiminishing equally on each side.\n\nAt that center, with wings spread wide,\nI saw more than a thousand rejoicing angels,\neach different in radiance and nature.\nI saw there, in their dancing and singing,\na beauty smiling—the very joy\nthat filled the eyes of all the other saints.\n\nAnd even if I had as much skill in words\nas I have in imagination,\nI would not dare attempt to describe\nthe smallest part of that delight.\n\nBernard, seeing my eyes\nfixed and intent on that burning love,\nturned his own to her\nwith such devotion\nthat it made mine burn even brighter to see.",

Absorbed in his delight, that contemplator Assumed the willing office of a teacher, And gave beginning to these holy words: \"The wound that Mary closed up and anointed, She at her feet who is so beautiful, She is the one who opened it and pierced it. Within that order which the third seats make Is seated Rachel, lower than the other, With Beatrice, in manner as thou seest. Sarah, Rebecca, Judith, and her who was Ancestress of the Singer, who for dole Of the misdeed said, 'Miserere mei,' Canst thou behold from seat to seat descending Down in gradation, as with each one's name I through the Rose go down from leaf to leaf. And downward from the seventh row, even as Above the same, succeed the Hebrew women, Dividing all the tresses of the flower; Because, according to the view which Faith In Christ had taken, these are the partition By which the sacred stairways are divided. Upon this side, where perfect is the flower With each one of its petals, seated are Those who believed in Christ who was to come. Upon the other side, where intersected With vacant spaces are the semicircles, Are those who looked to Christ already come. And as, upon this side, the glorious seat Of the Lady of Heaven, and the other seats Below it, such a great division make, 416 So opposite doth that of the great John, Who, ever holy, desert and martyrdom Endured, and afterwards two years in Hell. And under him thus to divide were chosen Francis, and Benedict, and Augustine, And down to us the rest from round to round. Behold now the high providence divine; For one and other aspect of the Faith In equal measure shall this garden fill. And know that downward from that rank which cleaves Midway the sequence of the two divisions, Not by their proper merit are they seated; But by another's under fixed conditions; For these are spirits one and all assoiled Before they any true election had. Well canst thou recognise it in their faces, And also in their voices puerile, If thou regard them well and hearken to them. Now doubtest thou, and doubting thou art silent; But I will loosen for thee the strong bond In which thy subtile fancies hold thee fast. Within the amplitude of this domain No casual point can possibly find place, No more than sadness can, or thirst, or hunger; For by eternal law has been established Whatever thou beholdest, so that closely The ring is fitted to the finger here. And therefore are these people, festinate Unto true life, not 'sine causa' here More and less excellent among themselves. The King, by means of whom this realm reposes In so great love and in so great delight That no will ventureth to ask for more, In his own joyous aspect every mind Creating, at his pleasure dowers with grace Diversely; and let here the effect suffice. And this is clearly and expressly noted For you in Holy Scripture, in those twins Who in their mother had their anger roused. According to the colour of the hair, 417 \nTherefore, with such a grace the light supreme Consenteth that they worthily be crowned. Without, then, any merit of their deeds, Stationed are they in different gradations, Differing only in their first acuteness. 'Tis true that in the early centuries, With innocence, to work out their salvation Sufficient was the faith of parents only. After the earlier ages were completed, Behoved it that the males by circumcision Unto their innocent wings should virtue add; But after that the time of grace had come Without the baptism absolute of Christ, Such innocence below there was retained. Look now into the face that unto Christ Hath most resemblance; for its brightness only Is able to prepare thee to see Christ.\" On her did I behold so great a gladness Rain down, borne onward in the holy minds Created through that altitude to fly, That whatsoever I had seen before Did not suspend me in such admiration, Nor show me such similitude of God. And the same Love that first descended there, \"Ave Maria, gratia plena,\" singing, In front of her his wings expanded wide. Unto the canticle divine responded From every part the court beatified, So that each sight became serener for it. \"O holy father, who for me endurest To be below here, leaving the sweet place In which thou sittest by eternal lot, Who is the Angel that with so much joy Into the eyes is looking of our Queen, Enamoured so that he seems made of fire?\" Thus I again recourse had to the teaching Of that one who delighted him in Mary As doth the star of morning in the sun. And he to me: \"Such gallantry and grace As there can be in Angel and in soul, 418 \nAll is in him; and thus we fain would have it; Because he is the one who bore the palm Down unto Mary, when the Son of God To take our burden on himself decreed. But now come onward with thine eyes, as I Speaking shall go, and note the great patricians Of this most just and merciful of empires. Those two that sit above there most enrapture As being very near unto Augusta, Are as it were the two roots of this Rose. He who upon the left is near her placed The father is, by whose audacious taste The human species so much bitter tastes. Upon the right thou seest that ancient father Of Holy Church, into whose keeping Christ The keys committed of this lovely flower. And he who all the evil days beheld, Before his death, of her the beauteous bride Who with the spear and with the nails was won, Beside him sits, and by the other rests That leader under whom on manna lived The people ingrate, fickle, and stiff-necked. Opposite Peter seest thou Anna seated, So well content to look upon her daughter, Her eyes she moves not while she sings Hosanna. And opposite the eldest household father Lucia sits, she who thy Lady moved When to rush downward thou didst bend thy brows. But since the moments of thy vision fly, Here will we make full stop, as a good tailor Who makes the gown according to his cloth, And unto the first Love will turn our eyes, That looking upon Him thou penetrate As far as possible through his effulgence. Truly, lest peradventure thou recede, Moving thy wings believing to advance, By prayer behoves it that grace be obtained; Grace from that one who has the power to aid thee; And thou shalt follow me with thy affection That from my words thy heart turn not aside.\" 419 \nAnd he began this holy orison. 420",

Within thy womb rekindled was the love, By heat of which in the eternal peace After such wise this flower has germinated. Here unto us thou art a noonday torch Of charity, and below there among mortals Thou art the living fountain-head of hope. Lady, thou art so great, and so prevailing, That he who wishes grace, nor runs to thee, His aspirations without wings would fly. Not only thy benignity gives succour To him who asketh it, but oftentimes Forerunneth of its own accord the asking. In thee compassion is, in thee is pity, In thee magnificence; in thee unites Whate'er of goodness is in any creature. Now doth this man, who from the lowest depth Of the universe as far as here has seen One after one the spiritual lives, Supplicate thee through grace for so much power That with his eyes he may uplift himself Higher towards the uttermost salvation. And I, who never burned for my own seeing More than I do for his, all of my prayers 421 Proffer to thee, and pray they come not short, That thou wouldst scatter from him every cloud Of his mortality so with thy prayers, That the Chief Pleasure be to him displayed. Still farther do I pray thee, Queen, who canst Whate'er thou wilt, that sound thou mayst preserve After so great a vision his affections. Let thy protection conquer human movements; See Beatrice and all the blessed ones My prayers to second clasp their hands to thee!\" The eyes beloved and revered of God, Fastened upon the speaker, showed to us How grateful unto her are prayers devout; Then unto the Eternal Light they turned, On which it is not credible could be By any creature bent an eye so clear. And I, who to the end of all desires Was now approaching, even as I ought The ardour of desire within me ended. Bernard was beckoning unto me, and smiling, That I should upward look; but I already Was of my own accord such as he wished; Because my sight, becoming purified, Was entering more and more into the ray Of the High Light which of itself is true. From that time forward what I saw was greater Than our discourse, that to such vision yields, And yields the memory unto such excess. Even as he is who seeth in a dream, And after dreaming the imprinted passion Remains, and to his mind the rest returns not, Even such am I, for almost utterly Ceases my vision, and distilleth yet Within my heart the sweetness born of it; Even thus the snow is in the sun unsealed, Even thus upon the wind in the light leaves Were the soothsayings of the Sibyl lost. O Light Supreme, that dost so far uplift thee From the conceits of mortals, to my mind Of what thou didst appear re-lend a little, 422 \nAnd make my tongue of so great puissance, That but a single sparkle of thy glory It may bequeath unto the future people; For by returning to my memory somewhat, And by a little sounding in these verses, More of thy victory shall be conceived! I think the keenness of the living ray Which I endured would have bewildered me, If but mine eyes had been averted from it; And I remember that I was more bold On this account to bear, so that I joined My aspect with the Glory Infinite. O grace abundant, by which I presumed To fix my sight upon the Light Eternal, So that the seeing I consumed therein! I saw that in its depth far down is lying Bound up with love together in one volume, What through the universe in leaves is scattered; Substance, and accident, and their operations, All interfused together in such wise That what I speak of is one simple light. The universal fashion of this knot Methinks I saw, since more abundantly In saying this I feel that I rejoice. One moment is more lethargy to me, Than five and twenty centuries to the emprise That startled Neptune with the shade of Argo! My mind in this wise wholly in suspense, Steadfast, immovable, attentive gazed, And evermore with gazing grew enkindled. In presence of that light one such becomes, That to withdraw therefrom for other prospect It is impossible he e'er consent; Because the good, which object is of will, Is gathered all in this, and out of it That is defective which is perfect there. Shorter henceforward will my language fall Of what I yet remember, than an infant's Who still his tongue doth moisten at the breast. Not because more than one unmingled semblance 423 \nWas in the living light on which I looked, For it is always what it was before; But through the sight, that fortified itself In me by looking, one appearance only To me was ever changing as I changed. Within the deep and luminous subsistence Of the High Light appeared to me three circles, Of threefold colour and of one dimension, And by the second seemed the first reflected As Iris is by Iris, and the third Seemed fire that equally from both is breathed. O how all speech is feeble and falls short Of my conceit, and this to what I saw Is such, 'tis not enough to call it little! O Light Eterne, sole in thyself that dwellest, Sole knowest thyself, and, known unto thyself And knowing, lovest and smilest on thyself! That circulation, which being thus conceived Appeared in thee as a reflected light, When somewhat contemplated by mine eyes, Within itself, of its own very colour Seemed to me painted with our effigy, Wherefore my sight was all absorbed therein. As the geometrician, who endeavours To square the circle, and discovers not, By taking thought, the principle he wants, Even such was I at that new apparition; I wished to see how the image to the circle Conformed itself, and how it there finds place; But my own wings were not enough for this, Had it not been that then my mind there smote A flash of lightning, wherein came its wish. Here vigour failed the lofty fantasy: But now was turning my desire and will, Even as a wheel that equally is moved, The Love which moves the sun and the other stars. 424 \nLoved this book ? Similar users also downloaded The Art of War , Sun Tzu The Art of War is a Chinese military treatise that was written during the 6th century BC by Sun Tzu. Composed of 13 chapters, each of which is devoted to one aspect of warfare, it has long been praised as the defin- itive work on military strategies and tactics of its time. The Art of War is one of the oldest books on military strategy in the world. It is the first and one of the most successful works on strategy and has had a huge influence on Eastern and Western military thinking, busi- ness tactics, and beyond. Sun Tzu was the first to recognize the import- ance of positioning in strategy and that position is affected both by ob- jective conditions in the physical environment and the subjective opin- ions of competitive actors in that environment. He taught that strategy was not planning in the sense of working through a to-do list, but rather that it requires quick and appropriate responses to changing conditions. Planning works in a controlled environment, but in a competitive environment, War and Peace , Lev Nikolayevich Tolstoy War and Peace is a novel by Leo Tolstoy, first published from 1865 to 1869 in Russkii Vestnik, which tells the story of Russian society during the Napoleonic Era. It is usually described as one of Tolstoy's two major masterpieces (the other being Anna Karenina) as well as one of the world's greatest novels. War and Peace offered a new kind of fiction, with a great many charac- ters caught up in a plot that covered nothing less than the grand subjects indicated by the title, combined with the equally large topics of youth, marriage, age, and death. Though it is often called a novel today, it broke so many conventions of the form that it was not considered a novel in its time. Indeed, Tolstoy himself considered Anna Karenina (1878) to be his first attempt at a novel in the European sense. Grimm's Fairy Tales , Jacob Ludwig Karl Grimm Children's and Household Tales (German: Kinder- und Hausmärchen) is a collection of German origin fairy tales first published in 1812 by Ja- cob and Wilhelm Grimm, the Brothers Grimm. The collection is com- monly known today as Grimms' Fairy Tales (German: Grimms Märchen). 425 \nBeyond Good and Evil , Friedrich Wilhelm Nietzsche Beyond Good and Evil (German: Jenseits von Gut und Böse), subtitled \"Prelude to a Philosophy of the Future\" (Vorspiel einer Philosophie der Zukunft), is a book by the German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, first published in 1886. It takes up and expands on the ideas of his previous work, Thus Spoke Zarathustra, but approached from a more critical, polemical direction. In Beyond Good and Evil, Nietzsche attacks past philosophers for their alleged lack of critical sense and their blind acceptance of Christian premises in their consideration of morality. The work moves into the realm \"beyond good and evil\" in the sense of leaving behind the tradi- tional morality which Nietzsche subjects to a destructive critique in fa- vour of what he regards as an affirmative approach that fearlessly con- fronts the perspectival nature of knowledge and the perilous condition of the modern individual. The Picture of Dorian Gray , Oscar Wilde Oscar Wilde's story of a fashionable young man who sells his soul for eternal youth and beauty is one of his most popular works. Written in Wilde's characteristically dazzling manner, full of stinging epigrams and shrewd observations, the tale of Dorian Gray's moral disintegration caused something of a scandal when it first appeared in 1890. Wilde was attacked for his decadence and corrupting influence, and a few years later the book and the aesthetic/ moral dilemma it presented became is- sues in the trials occasioned by Wilde's homosexual liaisons, trials that resulted in his imprisonment. Of the book's value as autobiography, Wilde noted in a letter, \"Basil Hallward is what I think I am: Lord Henry what the world thinks me: Dorian what I would like to be--in other ages, perhaps.\" Moby-Dick , Herman Melville Moby-Dick is an 1851 novel by Herman Melville. The story tells the adventures of the wandering sailor Ishmael and his voyage on the whal- ing ship Pequod, commanded by Captain Ahab. Ishmael soon learns that Ahab seeks one specific whale, Moby-Dick, a white whale of tremendous size and ferocity. Comparatively few whaling ships know of Moby-Dick, and fewer yet have encountered him. In a previous encounter, the whale destroyed Ahab's boat and bit off his leg. Ahab intends to exact revenge. 426 \nAlice's Adventures in Wonderland , Lewis Carroll Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865) is a novel written by English author Charles Lutwidge Dodgson, better known under the pseudonym Lewis Carroll. It tells the story of a girl named Alice who falls down a rabbit-hole into a fantasy world populated by peculiar and anthropo- morphic creatures. The tale is filled with allusions to Dodgson's friends (and enemies), and to the lessons that British schoolchildren were expected to memorize. The tale plays with logic in ways that have made the story of lasting pop- ularity with adults as well as children. It is considered to be one of the most characteristic examples of the genre of literary nonsense, and its narrative course and structure has been enormously influential, mainly in the fantasy genre. The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes , Arthur Conan Doyle The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes is a collection of twelve stories by Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, featuring his famous detective and illustrated by Sidney Paget. These are the first of the Sherlock Holmes short stories, originally pub- lished as single stories in the Strand Magazine from July 1891 to June 1892. The book was published in England on October 14, 1892 by George Newnes Ltd and in a US Edition on October 15 by Harper. The initial combined print run was 14,500 copies. The Count of Monte Cristo , Alexandre Dumas The Count of Monte Cristo (French: Le Comte de Monte-Cristo) is an adventure novel by Alexandre Dumas, père. It is often considered, along with The Three Musketeers, as Dumas' most popular work. It is also among the highest selling books of all time. The writing of the work was completed in 1844. Like many of his novels, it is expanded from the plot outlines suggested by his collaborating ghostwriter Auguste Maquet. The story takes place in France, Italy, islands in the Mediterranean and the Levant during the historical events of 1815–1838 (from just before the Hundred Days through the reign of Louis-Philippe of France). The his- torical setting is a fundamental element of the book. It is primarily con- cerned with themes of hope, justice, vengeance, mercy, forgiveness and death, and is told in the style of an adventure story. The Curious Case of Benjamin Button , Francis Scott Fitzgerald 427 \nThis story was inspired by a remark of Mark Twain's to the effect that it was a pity that the best part of life came at the beginning and the worst part at the end. By trying the experiment upon only one man in a per- fectly normal world I have scarcely given his idea a fair trial. Several weeks after completing it, I discovered an almost identical plot in Samuel Butler's \"Note-books.\" The story was published in \"Collier's\" last summer and provoked this startling letter from an anonymous admirer in Cincinnati: \"Sir-- I have read the story Benjamin Button in Colliers and I wish to say that as a short story writer you would make a good lunatic I have seen many peices of cheese in my life but of all the peices of cheese I have ever seen you are the biggest peice.

rekindled the love\nby whose warmth, in the eternal peace,\nthis flower has bloomed.\n\nHere you are our blazing torch of charity,\nand below among mortals\nyou are the living wellspring of hope.\n\nLady, you are so great and powerful\nthat whoever desires grace but does not turn to you\ntries to make his longings fly without wings.\n\nYour kindness not only helps\nthose who ask for it,\nbut often runs ahead of the asking itself.\n\nIn you is compassion, in you is mercy,\nin you magnificence—in you is gathered\nwhatever goodness exists in any creature.\n\nNow this man, who from the deepest pit\nof the universe to here has witnessed\nthe spiritual lives one by one,\nbegs you for grace to gain such power\nthat he may lift his eyes still higher\ntoward the ultimate salvation.\n\nAnd I, who never burned more for my own vision\nthan I do for his, offer you all my prayers—\nand pray they prove sufficient—\nthat you would scatter from him every cloud\nof mortality with your prayers,\nso that the Supreme Joy might be revealed to him.\n\nI pray further, Queen, you who can do\nwhatever you will, that you preserve\nhis heart's devotion after so great a vision.\nLet your protection overcome human frailty.\nSee how Beatrice and all the blessed ones\nclasp their hands together, joining my prayers to you!\n\nThe eyes beloved and revered by God,\nfixed upon the one who spoke,\nshowed us how welcome devout prayers are to her.\n\nThen they turned toward the Eternal Light—\nthat Light on which no creature\ncould believably focus such a clear gaze.\n\nAnd I, who was approaching\nthe end of all desires,\nfelt the fire of longing within me reach its peak, as it should.\n\nBernard smiled and gestured for me to look upward,\nbut I was already doing\nexactly what he wanted,\nbecause my sight, becoming purified,\nwas entering deeper and deeper\ninto the ray of that High Light which is truth itself.\n\nFrom that moment on, what I saw\nwas greater than our language can express—\nspeech fails before such vision,\nand memory surrenders to such overwhelming experience.\n\nLike someone who sees something in a dream,\nand after waking the feeling remains\nbut nothing else returns to mind,\nso am I now—my vision has almost entirely\nfaded away, yet still distilling\nin my heart is the sweetness born from it.\n\nSo snow melts under the sun's touch,\nso the Sibyl's prophecies written on light leaves\nwere lost upon the wind.\n\nO Supreme Light, you who rise so far\nabove mortal understanding,\nlend back to my mind a little of what you appeared to be,\nand give my tongue such power\nthat it might leave just one spark of your glory\nfor future generations.\n\nBy returning somewhat to my memory\nand sounding even faintly in these verses,\nmore of your victory will be grasped.\n\nI believe the intensity of the living ray\nI endured would have overwhelmed me\nif I had turned my eyes away from it.\n\nI remember I grew bolder\nbecause of this, so much that I joined\nmy gaze with the Infinite Glory.\n\nO abundant grace, through which I dared\nto fix my sight upon the Eternal Light\nuntil my vision was consumed in it!\n\nIn its depths I saw gathered together,\nbound by love into a single volume,\neverything that is scattered in pages throughout the universe—\n\nsubstance and accidents and their workings,\nall fused together in such a way\nthat what I'm describing is one simple light.\n\nI believe I saw the universal form\nof this great knot,\nbecause as I say this I feel my joy expand.\n\nA single moment brings me more forgetfulness\nthan twenty-five centuries brought to the voyage\nthat made Neptune marvel at the Argo's shadow.\n\nMy mind, completely suspended this way,\ngazed steadfast, motionless, attentive,\nand grew more inflamed the more it watched.\n\nIn the presence of that light, one becomes such\nthat it's impossible to ever consent\nto turn away from it toward any other sight,\n\nbecause the good that is the object of the will\nis gathered completely there,\nand outside it, what is perfect there becomes defective.\n\nMy words will fall shorter now\nin describing what I still remember\nthan an infant's whose tongue still seeks the breast.\n\nNot because the living light I gazed upon\ncontained more than one pure image—\nit is always what it was before—\nbut because my sight grew stronger\nby looking, that one appearance\nkept transforming as I myself changed.\n\nWithin the deep, luminous substance\nof the High Light, three circles appeared to me\nof three colors but one size,\nand one seemed reflected by the second\nlike rainbow reflected in rainbow,\nand the third seemed fire breathed equally from both.\n\nHow feeble all speech is, how it falls short\nof my conception! And compared to what I saw,\ncalling this inadequate is not enough.\n\nO Eternal Light, existing in yourself alone,\nalone understanding yourself, and understood\nby yourself and understanding, you love and smile upon yourself!\n\nThat circle which appeared in you\nas reflected light,\nwhen my eyes contemplated it awhile,\nseemed painted within itself, in its own color,\nwith our human image—\nand so my sight was completely absorbed in it.\n\nLike a mathematician struggling\nto square the circle, who cannot discover\nthrough thought the principle he needs,\nso was I faced with that new vision.\n\nI wanted to see how the image fit the circle,\nhow it found its place there,\nbut my own wings were not sufficient for this—\nexcept that then my mind was struck\nby a flash of lightning that fulfilled its wish.\n\nHere my high imagination lost its power,\nbut already my desire and will were turning,\nlike a wheel that spins with perfect balance,\nmoved by the Love that moves the sun and all the stars.",
